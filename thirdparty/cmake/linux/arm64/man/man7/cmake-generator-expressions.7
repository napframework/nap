.SH NAME
cmake-generator-expressions \- CMake Generator Expressions
.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system generation to produce
information specific to each build configuration.  They have the form
\fB$<...>\fP\&.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
target_include_directories(tgt PRIVATE /opt/include/$<CXX_COMPILER_ID>)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This would expand to \fB/opt/include/GNU\fP, \fB/opt/include/Clang\fP, etc.
depending on the C++ compiler used.
.sp
Generator expressions are allowed in the context of many target properties,
such as \fI\%LINK_LIBRARIES\fP, \fI\%INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP,
\fI\%COMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP and others.  They may also be used when using
commands to populate those properties, such as \fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP,
\fI\%target_include_directories()\fP, \fI\%target_compile_definitions()\fP
and others.  They enable conditional linking, conditional definitions used when
compiling, conditional include directories, and more.  The conditions may be
based on the build configuration, target properties, platform information,
or any other queryable information.
.sp
Generator expressions can be nested:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
target_compile_definitions(tgt PRIVATE
  $<$<VERSION_LESS:$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION>,4.2.0>:OLD_COMPILER>
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above would expand to \fBOLD_COMPILER\fP if the
\fI\%CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION\fP is less
than 4.2.0.
.SH WHITESPACE AND QUOTING
.sp
Generator expressions are typically parsed after command arguments.
If a generator expression contains spaces, new lines, semicolons or
other characters that may be interpreted as command argument separators,
the whole expression should be surrounded by quotes when passed to a
command.  Failure to do so may result in the expression being split and
it may no longer be recognized as a generator expression.
.sp
When using \fI\%add_custom_command()\fP or \fI\%add_custom_target()\fP,
use the \fBVERBATIM\fP and \fBCOMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS\fP options to obtain robust
argument splitting and quoting.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# WRONG: Embedded space will be treated as an argument separator.
# This ends up not being seen as a generator expression at all.
add_custom_target(run_some_tool
  COMMAND some_tool \-I$<JOIN:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>, \-I>
  VERBATIM
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Better, but still not robust. Quotes prevent the space from splitting the
# expression. However, the tool will receive the expanded value as a single
# argument.
add_custom_target(run_some_tool
  COMMAND some_tool \(dq\-I$<JOIN:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>, \-I>\(dq
  VERBATIM
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Nearly correct. Using a semicolon to separate arguments and adding the
# COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS option means that paths with spaces will be handled
# correctly. Quoting the whole expression ensures it is seen as a generator
# expression. But if the target property is empty, we will get a bare \-I
# with nothing after it.
add_custom_target(run_some_tool
  COMMAND some_tool \(dq\-I$<JOIN:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>,;\-I>\(dq
  COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS
  VERBATIM
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using variables to build up a more complex generator expression is also a
good way to reduce errors and improve readability.  The above example can be
improved further like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# The $<BOOL:...> check prevents adding anything if the property is empty,
# assuming the property value cannot be one of CMake\(aqs false constants.
set(prop \(dq$<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>\(dq)
add_custom_target(run_some_tool
  COMMAND some_tool \(dq$<$<BOOL:${prop}>:\-I$<JOIN:${prop},;\-I>>\(dq
  COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS
  VERBATIM
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, the above example can be expressed in a more simple and robust way
using an alternate generator expression:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_custom_target(run_some_tool
  COMMAND some_tool \(dq$<LIST:TRANSFORM,$<TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>,PREPEND,\-I>\(dq
  COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS
  VERBATIM
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A common mistake is to try to split a generator expression across multiple
lines with indenting:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# WRONG: New lines and spaces all treated as argument separators, so the
# generator expression is split and not recognized correctly.
target_compile_definitions(tgt PRIVATE
  $<$<AND:
      $<CXX_COMPILER_ID:GNU>,
      $<VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL:$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION>,5>
    >:HAVE_5_OR_LATER>
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Again, use helper variables with well\-chosen names to build up a readable
expression instead:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(is_gnu \(dq$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:GNU>\(dq)
set(v5_or_later \(dq$<VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL:$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION>,5>\(dq)
set(meet_requirements \(dq$<AND:${is_gnu},${v5_or_later}>\(dq)
target_compile_definitions(tgt PRIVATE
  \(dq$<${meet_requirements}:HAVE_5_OR_LATER>\(dq
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DEBUGGING
.sp
Since generator expressions are evaluated during generation of the buildsystem,
and not during processing of \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP files, it is not possible to
inspect their result with the \fI\%message()\fP command.  One possible way
to generate debug messages is to add a custom target:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_custom_target(genexdebug COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} \-E echo \(dq$<...>\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After running \fBcmake\fP, you can then build the \fBgenexdebug\fP target to print
the result of the \fB$<...>\fP expression (i.e. run the command
\fI\%cmake \-\-build ... \-\-target genexdebug\fP).
.sp
Another way is to write debug messages to a file with \fI\%file(GENERATE)\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file(GENERATE OUTPUT filename CONTENT \(dq$<...>\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH GENERATOR EXPRESSION REFERENCE
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This reference deviates from most of the CMake documentation in that it
omits angular brackets \fB<...>\fP around placeholders like \fBcondition\fP,
\fBstring\fP, \fBtarget\fP, etc.  This is to prevent an opportunity for those
placeholders to be misinterpreted as generator expressions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Conditional Expressions
.sp
A fundamental category of generator expressions relates to conditional logic.
Two forms of conditional generator expressions are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<condition:true_string>
Evaluates to \fBtrue_string\fP if \fBcondition\fP is \fB1\fP, or an empty string
if \fBcondition\fP evaluates to \fB0\fP\&.  Any other value for \fBcondition\fP
results in an error.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<IF:condition,true_string,false_string>
New in version 3.8.

.sp
Evaluates to \fBtrue_string\fP if \fBcondition\fP is \fB1\fP, or \fBfalse_string\fP
if \fBcondition\fP is \fB0\fP\&.  Any other value for \fBcondition\fP results in an
error.
.sp
New in version 3.28: This generator expression short\-circuits such that generator expressions in
\fBfalse_string\fP will not evaluate when \fBcondition\fP is \fB1\fP, and generator
expressions in \fBtrue_string\fP will not evaluate when condition is \fB0\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.sp
Typically, the \fBcondition\fP is itself a generator expression.  For instance,
the following expression expands to \fBDEBUG_MODE\fP when the \fBDebug\fP
configuration is used, and the empty string for all other configurations:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Boolean\-like \fBcondition\fP values other than \fB1\fP or \fB0\fP can be handled
by wrapping them with the \fB$<BOOL:...>\fP generator expression:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<BOOL:string>
Converts \fBstring\fP to \fB0\fP or \fB1\fP\&. Evaluates to \fB0\fP if any of the
following is true:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring\fP is empty,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring\fP is a case\-insensitive equal of
\fB0\fP, \fBFALSE\fP, \fBOFF\fP, \fBN\fP, \fBNO\fP, \fBIGNORE\fP, or \fBNOTFOUND\fP, or
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring\fP ends in the suffix \fB\-NOTFOUND\fP (case\-sensitive).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Otherwise evaluates to \fB1\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB$<BOOL:...>\fP generator expression is often used when a \fBcondition\fP
is provided by a CMake variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$<$<BOOL:${HAVE_SOME_FEATURE}>:\-DENABLE_SOME_FEATURE>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Logical Operators
.sp
The common boolean logic operators are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<AND:conditions>
where \fBconditions\fP is a comma\-separated list of boolean expressions,
all of which must evaluate to either \fB1\fP or \fB0\fP\&.  The whole expression
evaluates to \fB1\fP if all conditions are \fB1\fP\&.  If any condition is \fB0\fP,
the whole expression evaluates to \fB0\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<OR:conditions>
where \fBconditions\fP is a comma\-separated list of boolean expressions.
all of which must evaluate to either \fB1\fP or \fB0\fP\&.  The whole expression
evaluates to \fB1\fP if at least one of the \fBconditions\fP is \fB1\fP\&.  If all
\fBconditions\fP evaluate to \fB0\fP, the whole expression evaluates to \fB0\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<NOT:condition>
\fBcondition\fP must be \fB0\fP or \fB1\fP\&.  The result of the expression is
\fB0\fP if \fBcondition\fP is \fB1\fP, else \fB1\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
New in version 3.28: Logical operators short\-circuit such that generator expressions in the
arguments list will not be evaluated once a return value can be determined.

.SS Primary Comparison Expressions
.sp
CMake supports a variety of generator expressions that compare things.
This section covers the primary and most widely used comparison types.
Other more specific comparison types are documented in their own separate
sections further below.
.SS String Comparisons
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<STREQUAL:string1,string2>
\fB1\fP if \fBstring1\fP and \fBstring2\fP are equal, else \fB0\fP\&.
The comparison is case\-sensitive.  For a case\-insensitive comparison,
combine with a \fI\%string transforming generator expression\fP\&.  For example, the following
evaluates to \fB1\fP if \fB${foo}\fP is any of \fBBAR\fP, \fBBar\fP, \fBbar\fP, etc.
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$<STREQUAL:$<UPPER_CASE:${foo}>,BAR>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<EQUAL:value1,value2>
\fB1\fP if \fBvalue1\fP and \fBvalue2\fP are numerically equal, else \fB0\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Version Comparisons
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<VERSION_LESS:v1,v2>
\fB1\fP if \fBv1\fP is a version less than \fBv2\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2>
\fB1\fP if \fBv1\fP is a version greater than \fBv2\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2>
\fB1\fP if \fBv1\fP is the same version as \fBv2\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<VERSION_LESS_EQUAL:v1,v2>
New in version 3.7.

.sp
\fB1\fP if \fBv1\fP is a version less than or equal to \fBv2\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL:v1,v2>
New in version 3.7.

.sp
\fB1\fP if \fBv1\fP is a version greater than or equal to \fBv2\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS String Transformations
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LOWER_CASE:string>
Content of \fBstring\fP converted to lower case.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<UPPER_CASE:string>
Content of \fBstring\fP converted to upper case.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER:...>
Content of \fB\&...\fP converted to a C identifier.  The conversion follows the
same behavior as \fI\%string(MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER)\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS List Expressions
.sp
Most of the expressions in this section are closely associated with the
\fI\%list()\fP command, providing the same capabilities, but in
the form of a generator expression.
.sp
In each of the following list\-related generator expressions, the \fBlist\fP
must not contain any commas if that generator expression expects something to
be provided after the \fBlist\fP\&.  For example, the expression
\fB$<LIST:FIND,list,value>\fP requires a \fBvalue\fP after the \fBlist\fP\&.
Since a comma is used to separate the \fBlist\fP and the \fBvalue\fP, the \fBlist\fP
cannot itself contain a comma.  This restriction does not apply to the
\fI\%list()\fP command, it is specific to the list\-handling generator
expressions only.
.SS List Comparisons
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<IN_LIST:string,list>
New in version 3.12.

.sp
\fB1\fP if \fBstring\fP is an item in the semicolon\-separated \fBlist\fP, else \fB0\fP\&.
It uses case\-sensitive comparisons.
.UNINDENT
.SS List Queries
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:LENGTH,list>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
The number of items in the \fBlist\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:GET,list,index,...>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
Expands to the list of items specified by indices from the \fBlist\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:SUBLIST,list,begin,length>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
A sublist of the given \fBlist\fP\&.  If \fBlength\fP is 0, an empty list
will be returned.  If \fBlength\fP is \-1 or the list is smaller than
\fBbegin + length\fP, the remaining items of the list starting at
\fBbegin\fP will be returned.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:FIND,list,value>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
The index of the first item in \fBlist\fP with the specified \fBvalue\fP,
or \-1 if \fBvalue\fP is not in the \fBlist\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS List Transformations
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:JOIN,list,glue>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
Converts \fBlist\fP to a single string with the content of the \fBglue\fP string
inserted between each item.  This is conceptually the same operation as
\fI\%$<JOIN:list,glue>\fP, but the two have different behavior with regard
to empty items.  \fB$<LIST:JOIN,list,glue>\fP preserves all empty items,
whereas \fI\%$<JOIN:list,glue>\fP drops all empty items from the list.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:APPEND,list,item,...>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
The \fBlist\fP with each \fBitem\fP appended.  Multiple items should be
separated by commas.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:PREPEND,list,item,...>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
The \fBlist\fP with each \fBitem\fP inserted at the beginning.  If there are
multiple items, they should be separated by commas, and the order of the
prepended items will be preserved.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:INSERT,list,index,item,...>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
The \fBlist\fP with the \fBitem\fP (or multiple items) inserted at the specified
\fBindex\fP\&.  Multiple items should be separated by commas.
.sp
It is an error to specify an out\-of\-range \fBindex\fP\&. Valid indexes are 0 to N,
where N is the length of the list, inclusive. An empty list has length 0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:POP_BACK,list>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
The \fBlist\fP with the last item removed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:POP_FRONT,list>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
The \fBlist\fP with the first item removed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:REMOVE_ITEM,list,value,...>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
The \fBlist\fP with all instances of the given \fBvalue\fP (or values) removed.
If multiple values are given, they should be separated by commas.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:REMOVE_DUPLICATES,list>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
The \fBlist\fP with all duplicated items removed.  The relative order of
items is preserved, but if duplicates are encountered, only the first
instance is preserved.  The result is the same as
\fI\%$<REMOVE_DUPLICATES:list>\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:FILTER,list,INCLUDE|EXCLUDE,regex>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
A list of items from the \fBlist\fP which match (\fBINCLUDE\fP) or do not match
(\fBEXCLUDE\fP) the regular expression \fBregex\fP\&.  The result is the same as
\fI\%$<FILTER:list,INCLUDE|EXCLUDE,regex>\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $<LIST:TRANSFORM,list,ACTION[,SELECTOR]>
New in version 3.27.

.sp
The \fBlist\fP transformed by applying an \fBACTION\fP to all or, by
specifying a \fBSELECTOR\fP, to the selected list items.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBTRANSFORM\fP sub\-command does not change the number of items in the
list. If a \fBSELECTOR\fP is specified, only some items will be changed,
the other ones will remain the same as before the transformation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBACTION\fP specifies the action to apply to the items of the list.
The actions have exactly the same semantics as for the
\fI\%list(TRANSFORM)\fP command.  \fBACTION\fP must be one of the following:
.INDENT 7.0

To determine the link language of a target, it is required to collect,
transitively, all the targets which will be linked to it. So, for link
libraries properties, a double evaluation will be done. During the first
evaluation, \fB$<LINK_LANGUAGE:..>\fP expressions will always return \fB0\fP\&.
The link language computed after this first pass will be used to do the
second pass. To avoid inconsistency, it is required that the second pass
do not change the link language. Moreover, to avoid unexpected
side\-effects, it is required to specify complete entities as part of the
\fB$<LINK_LANGUAGE:..>\fP expression. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

add_library(lib STATIC file.cxx)

In this example, for \fBmyapp1\fP, the first pass will, unexpectedly,
determine that the link language is \fBCXX\fP because the evaluation of the
generator expression will be an empty string so \fBmyapp1\fP will depends on
target \fBlib\fP which is \fBC++\fP\&. On the contrary, for \fBmyapp2\fP, the first
evaluation will give \fBC\fP as link language, so the second pass will
correctly add target \fBlibother\fP as link dependency.

.B \fBRESCAN\fP
Some linkers are single\-pass only.  For such linkers, circular references
between libraries typically result in unresolved symbols.  This feature
instructs the linker to search the specified static libraries repeatedly
until no new undefined references are created.
.sp
Normally, a static library is searched only once in the order that it is
specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that library is needed to
resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an object in a library that
appears later on the command line, the linker would not be able to resolve
that reference.  By grouping the static libraries with the \fBRESCAN\fP
feature, they will all be searched repeatedly until all possible references
are resolved.  This will use linker options like \fB\-\-start\-group\fP and
\fB\-\-end\-group\fP, or on SunOS, \fB\-z rescan\-start\fP and \fB\-z rescan\-end\fP\&.

Using this feature has a significant performance cost. It is best to use it

Because \fBlib1\fP is part of the group defined for \fBlib4\fP, that group then

List of DLLs that the target depends on at runtime. This is determined by

Using this generator expression on targets other than
executables, \fBSHARED\fP libraries, and \fBMODULE\fP libraries is an error.
\fBOn non\-DLL platforms, this expression always evaluates to an empty string\fP\&.

This generator expression can be used to copy all of the DLLs that a target

New in version 3.12.

.sp
Content of \fBexpr\fP evaluated as a generator expression in the context of
\fBtgt\fP target. This enables consumption of custom target properties that
themselves contain generator expressions.
.sp
Having the capability to evaluate generator expressions is very useful when
you want to manage custom properties supporting generator expressions.
For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(foo ...)

set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
  CUSTOM_KEYS $<$<CONFIG:DEBUG>:FOO_EXTRA_THINGS>
)

add_custom_target(printFooKeys
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} \-E echo $<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS>
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This naive implementation of the \fBprintFooKeys\fP custom command is wrong
because \fBCUSTOM_KEYS\fP target property is not evaluated and the content
is passed as is (i.e. \fB$<$<CONFIG:DEBUG>:FOO_EXTRA_THINGS>\fP).
.sp
To have the expected result (i.e. \fBFOO_EXTRA_THINGS\fP if config is
\fBDebug\fP), it is required to evaluate the output of
\fB$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS>\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_custom_target(printFooKeys
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} \-E
