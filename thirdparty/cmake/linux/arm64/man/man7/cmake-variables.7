.SH NAME
cmake-variables \- CMake Variables Reference
.sp
This page documents variables that are provided by CMake
or have meaning to CMake when set by project code.
.sp
For general information on variables, see the
\fI\%Variables\fP
section in the cmake\-language manual.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
CMake reserves identifiers that:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
begin with \fBCMAKE_\fP (upper\-, lower\-, or mixed\-case), or
.IP \(bu 2
begin with \fB_CMAKE_\fP (upper\-, lower\-, or mixed\-case), or
.IP \(bu 2
begin with \fB_\fP followed by the name of any \fI\%CMake Command\fP\&.

.SH VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION
.SS CMAKE_AR
.sp
Name of archiving tool for static libraries.
.sp
This specifies the name of the program that creates archive or static
libraries.
.SS CMAKE_ARGC
.sp
Number of command line arguments passed to CMake in script mode.
.sp
When run in \fI\%\-P\fP script mode, CMake sets this
variable to the number of command line arguments.  See also
\fI\%CMAKE_ARGV0\fP, \fB1\fP, \fB2\fP ...
.SS CMAKE_ARGV0
.sp
Command line argument passed to CMake in script mode.
.sp
When run in \fI\%\-P\fP script mode, CMake sets this
variable to the first command line argument.  It then also sets \fBCMAKE_ARGV1\fP,
\fBCMAKE_ARGV2\fP, ... and so on, up to the number of command line arguments
given.  See also \fI\%CMAKE_ARGC\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
.sp
The path to the top level of the build tree.
.sp
This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build
tree.  For an in\-source build, this would be the same as
\fI\%CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\fP\&.
.sp
When run in \fI\%cmake \-P\fP script mode, CMake sets the variables
\fBCMAKE_BINARY_DIR\fP, \fI\%CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR\fP to the current working directory.
.SS CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL
.sp
This variable exists only for backwards compatibility.
It contains the same value as \fI\%CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM\fP\&.
Use that variable instead.
.SS CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION
.sp
Major version of CMake used to create the \fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file
.sp
This stores the major version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.
.SS CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION
.sp
Minor version of CMake used to create the \fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file
.sp
This stores the minor version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.
.SS CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION
.sp
Patch version of CMake used to create the \fBCMakeCache.txt\fP file
.sp
This stores the patch version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.
.SS CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR
.sp
This variable is used internally by CMake, and may not be set during
the first configuration of a build tree.  When it is set, it has the
same value as \fI\%CMAKE_BINARY_DIR\fP\&.  Use that variable instead.
.SS CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR
.sp
Deprecated since version 3.21: This variable has poor support on \fI\%Ninja Multi\-Config\fP, and
predates the existence of the \fI\%$<CONFIG>\fP generator expression. Use
\fB$<CONFIG>\fP instead.

.sp
Build\-time reference to per\-configuration output subdirectory.
.sp
For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the
build tree (such as \fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP and \fI\%Xcode\fP),
the value is a reference to a build\-time variable specifying the name
of the per\-configuration output subdirectory.  On \fI\%Makefile Generators\fP
this evaluates to \fI\&.\fP because there is only one configuration in a build tree.
Example values:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$(Configuration)     = Visual Studio 12 and above
$(CONFIGURATION)     = Xcode
\&.                    = Make\-based tools
\&.                    = Ninja
${CONFIGURATION}     = Ninja Multi\-Config
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this
variable is suitable only for use in command lines that will be
evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT out.txt
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
          ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
  DEPENDS mytool in.txt
  )
add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that \fBCMAKE_CFG_INTDIR\fP is no longer necessary for this purpose but
has been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead
\fI\%add_custom_command()\fP recognizes executable target names in its
\fBCOMMAND\fP option, so
\fB${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool\fP can be replaced
by just \fBmytool\fP\&.
.sp
This variable is read\-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In
multi\-configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed
as the value of preprocessor symbol \fBCMAKE_INTDIR\fP to the compilation
of all source files.
.SS CMAKE_COMMAND
.sp
The full path to the \fI\%cmake(1)\fP executable.
.sp
This is the full path to the CMake executable \fI\%cmake(1)\fP which is
useful from custom commands that want to use the \fI\%cmake \-E\fP option for
portable system commands.  (e.g.  \fB/usr/local/bin/cmake\fP)
.SS CMAKE_CPACK_COMMAND
.sp
New in version 3.13.

.sp
Full path to \fI\%cpack(1)\fP command installed with CMake.
.sp
This is the full path to the CPack executable \fI\%cpack(1)\fP
that can be used for custom commands or tests to invoke
CPack commands.
.SS CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING
.sp
This variable is set by CMake to indicate whether it is cross compiling,
but note limitations discussed below.
.sp
This variable will be set to true by CMake if the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP
variable has been set manually (i.e. in a toolchain file or as a cache entry
from the \fI\%cmake\fP command line). In most cases, manually
setting \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP will only be done when cross compiling
since, if not manually set, it will be given the same value as
\fI\%CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME\fP, which is correct for
the non\-cross\-compiling case. In the event that \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP
is manually set to the same value as \fI\%CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME\fP, then
\fBCMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING\fP will still be set to true.
.sp
Another case to be aware of is that builds targeting Apple platforms other than
macOS are handled differently to other cross compiling scenarios. Rather than
relying on \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP to select the target platform, Apple
device builds use \fI\%CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT\fP to select the appropriate SDK,
which indirectly determines the target platform. Furthermore, when using the
\fI\%Xcode\fP generator, developers can switch between device and
simulator builds at build time rather than having a single
choice at configure time, so the concept
of whether the build is cross compiling or not is more complex. Therefore, the
use of \fBCMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING\fP is not recommended for projects targeting Apple
devices.
.SS CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR
.sp
New in version 3.3.

.sp
This variable is only used when \fI\%CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING\fP is on. It
should point to a command on the host system that can run executable built
for the target system.
.sp
New in version 3.15: If this variable contains a \fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP, then the first value is the command and remaining values are its
arguments.

.sp
New in version 3.28: This variable can be initialized via an
\fI\%CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR\fP environment variable.

.sp
The command will be used to run \fI\%try_run()\fP generated executables,
which avoids manual population of the \fBTryRunResults.cmake\fP file.
.sp
This variable is also used as the default value for the
\fI\%CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR\fP target property of executables.  However,
while \fI\%generator expressions\fP are
supported by the target property (since CMake 3.29), they are \fInot\fP supported
by this variable\(aqs \fI\%try_run()\fP functionality.
.SS CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND
.sp
Full path to \fI\%ctest(1)\fP command installed with CMake.
.sp
This is the full path to the CTest executable \fI\%ctest(1)\fP
that can be used for custom commands or tests to invoke
CTest commands.
.SS CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
.sp
The path to the binary directory currently being processed.
.sp
This is the full path to the build directory that is currently being
processed by cmake.  Each directory added by \fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP will
create a binary directory in the build tree, and as it is being
processed this variable will be set.  For in\-source builds this is the
current source directory being processed.
.sp
When run in \fI\%cmake \-P\fP script mode, CMake sets the variables
\fI\%CMAKE_BINARY_DIR\fP, \fI\%CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\fP,
\fBCMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR\fP to the current working directory.
.SS CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
When executing code inside a \fI\%function()\fP, this variable
contains the name of the current function.  It can be useful for
diagnostic or debug messages.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
When executing code inside a \fI\%function()\fP, this variable
contains the full directory of the listfile that defined the current function.
.sp
It is quite common practice in CMake for modules to use some additional files,
such as templates to be copied in after substituting CMake variables.
In such cases, a function needs to know where to locate those files in a way
that doesn\(aqt depend on where the function is called.  Without
\fBCMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR\fP, the code to do that would typically use
the following pattern:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(_THIS_MODULE_BASE_DIR \(dq${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}\(dq)

function(foo)
  configure_file(
    \(dq${_THIS_MODULE_BASE_DIR}/some.template.in\(dq
    some.output
  )
endfunction()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using \fBCMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR\fP inside the function instead
eliminates the need for the extra variable which would otherwise be visible
outside the function\(aqs scope.
The above example can be written in the more concise and more robust form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(foo)
  configure_file(
    \(dq${CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR}/some.template.in\(dq
    some.output
  )
endfunction()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
When executing code inside a \fI\%function()\fP, this variable
contains the full path to the listfile that defined the current function.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
When executing code inside a \fI\%function()\fP, this variable
contains the line number in the listfile where the current function
was defined.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR
.sp
Full directory of the listfile currently being processed.
.sp
As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
always be set to the directory where the listfile which is currently
being processed (\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE\fP) is located.  The value
has dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
it sets this variable to the directory where this file is located.
When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores the
previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or
function is the directory of the file invoking the bottom\-most entry
on the call stack, not the directory of the file containing the macro
or function definition.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE
.sp
Full path to the listfile currently being processed.
.sp
As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
always be set to the one currently being processed.  The value has
dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
it sets this variable to the location of the file.  When CMake
finishes processing commands from the file it restores the previous
value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function
is the file invoking the bottom\-most entry on the call stack, not the
file containing the macro or function definition.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE
.sp
The line number of the current file being processed.
.sp
This is the line number of the file currently being processed by
cmake.
.sp
If CMake is currently processing deferred calls scheduled by
the \fI\%cmake_language(DEFER)\fP command, this variable
evaluates to \fBDEFERRED\fP instead of a specific line number.
.SS CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR
.sp
The path to the source directory currently being processed.
.sp
This is the full path to the source directory that is currently being
processed by cmake.
.sp
When run in \fI\%cmake \-P\fP script mode, CMake sets the variables
\fI\%CMAKE_BINARY_DIR\fP, \fI\%CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP and
\fBCMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR\fP to the current working directory.
.SS CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES
.sp
Enables tracing output for target properties.
.sp
This variable can be populated with a list of properties to generate
debug output for when evaluating target properties.  Currently it can
only be used when evaluating:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%AUTOUIC_OPTIONS\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%COMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%COMPILE_FEATURES\fP

\fI\%LINK_OPTIONS\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%SOURCES\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
target properties and any other property listed in
\fI\%COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING\fP and other
\fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_\fP properties.  It outputs an origin for each entry
in the target property.  Default is unset.
.SS CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS
.sp
New in version 3.10.

.sp
Specify labels for the current directory.
.sp
This is used to initialize the \fI\%LABELS\fP directory property.
.SS CMAKE_DL_LIBS
.sp
Name of library containing \fBdlopen\fP and \fBdlclose\fP\&.
.sp
The name of the library that has \fBdlopen\fP and \fBdlclose\fP in it, usually
\fB\-ldl\fP on most UNIX machines.
.SS CMAKE_DOTNET_SDK
.sp
New in version 3.23.

.sp
Default value for \fI\%DOTNET_SDK\fP property of targets.
.sp
This variable is used to initialize the \fI\%DOTNET_SDK\fP
property on all targets. See that target property for additional information.
.SS CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
Default value for \fI\%DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK\fP property  of
targets.
.sp
This variable is used to initialize the
\fI\%DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK\fP property on all targets. See that
target property for additional information.
.sp
Setting \fBCMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK\fP may be necessary
when working with \fBC#\fP and newer .NET framework versions to
avoid referencing errors with the \fBALL_BUILD\fP CMake target.
.sp
This variable is only evaluated for \fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP
VS 2010 and above.
.SS CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION
.sp
New in version 3.12.

.sp
Default value for \fI\%DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION\fP
property of targets.
.sp
This variable is used to initialize the
\fI\%DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION\fP property on all
targets. See that target property for additional information. When set,
\fI\%CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK\fP takes precednece over this
variable. See that variable or the associated target property
\fI\%DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK\fP for additional information.
.sp
Setting \fBCMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION\fP may be necessary
when working with \fBC#\fP and newer .NET framework versions to
avoid referencing errors with the \fBALL_BUILD\fP CMake target.
.sp
This variable is only evaluated for \fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP
VS 2010 and above.
.SS CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND
.sp
Full path to \fI\%cmake\-gui(1)\fP or \fI\%ccmake(1)\fP\&.  Defined only for
\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP and \fI\%Ninja Generators\fP when not using any
\fI\%Extra Generators\fP\&.
.sp
This is the full path to the CMake executable that can graphically
edit the cache.  For example, \fI\%cmake\-gui(1)\fP or \fI\%ccmake(1)\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX
.sp
The suffix for executables on this platform.
.sp
The suffix to use for the end of an executable filename if any, \fB\&.exe\fP
on Windows.
.sp
\fI\%CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_<LANG>\fP overrides this for
language \fB<LANG>\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_<LANG>
.sp
The suffix to use for the end of an executable filename of \fB<LANG>\fP
compiler target architecture, if any.
.sp
It overrides \fI\%CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX\fP for language \fB<LANG>\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
.sp
Additional suffixes for shared libraries.
.sp
Extensions for shared libraries other than that specified by
\fI\%CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX\fP, if any.  CMake uses this to recognize
external shared library files during analysis of libraries linked by a
target.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
Print extra find call information for the following commands to standard
error:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%find_program()\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%find_library()\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%find_file()\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%find_path()\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%find_package()\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Output is designed for human consumption and not for parsing.
Enabling this variable is equivalent to using \fI\%cmake \-\-debug\-find\fP
with the added ability to enable debugging for a subset of find calls.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE TRUE)
find_program(...)
set(CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE FALSE)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Default is unset.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME
.sp
New in version 3.1.1.

.sp
Defined by the \fI\%find_package()\fP command while loading
a find module to record the caller\-specified package name.
See command documentation for details.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR
.sp
New in version 3.24.

.sp
This read\-only variable specifies a directory that the \fI\%find_package()\fP
command will check first before searching anywhere else for a module or config
package file.  A config package file in this directory will always be found in
preference to any other Find module file or config package file.
.sp
The primary purpose of this variable is to facilitate integration between
\fI\%find_package()\fP and \fI\%FetchContent_MakeAvailable()\fP\&.  The latter
command may create files in the \fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR\fP directory
when it populates a dependency.  This allows subsequent calls to
\fI\%find_package()\fP for the same dependency to reuse the populated
contents instead of trying to satisfy the dependency from somewhere external
to the build.  Projects may also want to write files into this directory in
some situations (see \fI\%Integrating With find_package()\fP
for examples).
.sp
The directory that \fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR\fP points to will always
be erased and recreated empty at the start of every CMake run.  Any files
written into this directory during the CMake run will be lost the next time
CMake configures the project.
.sp
\fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR\fP is only set in CMake project mode.
It is not set when CMake is run in script mode
(i.e. \fI\%cmake \-P\fP).
.SS CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
The sorting direction used by \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER\fP\&.
It can assume one of the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBDEC\fP
Default.  Ordering is done in descending mode.
The highest folder found will be tested first.
.TP
.B \fBASC\fP
Ordering is done in ascending mode.
The lowest folder found will be tested first.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER\fP is not set or is set to \fBNONE\fP
this variable has no effect.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
The default order for sorting packages found using \fI\%find_package()\fP\&.
It can assume one of the following values:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBNONE\fP
Default.  No attempt is done to sort packages.
The first valid package found will be selected.
.TP
.B \fBNAME\fP
Sort packages lexicographically before selecting one.
.TP
.B \fBNATURAL\fP
Sort packages using natural order (see \fBstrverscmp(3)\fP manual),
i.e. such that contiguous digits are compared as whole numbers.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Natural sorting can be employed to return the highest version when multiple
versions of the same library are found by \fI\%find_package()\fP\&.  For
example suppose that the following libraries have been found:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
libX\-1.1.0
.IP \(bu 2
libX\-1.2.9
.IP \(bu 2
libX\-1.2.10
.UNINDENT
.sp
By setting \fBNATURAL\fP order we can select the one with the highest
version number \fBlibX\-1.2.10\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER NATURAL)
find_package(libX CONFIG)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The sort direction can be controlled using the
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION\fP variable
(by default decrescent, e.g. lib\-B will be tested before lib\-A).
.SS CMAKE_GENERATOR
.sp
The generator used to build the project.  See \fI\%cmake\-generators(7)\fP\&.
.sp
The name of the generator that is being used to generate the build
files.  (e.g.  \fBUnix Makefiles\fP, \fBNinja\fP, etc.)
.sp
The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.
A generator may be selected via the \fI\%cmake \-G\fP option,
interactively in \fI\%cmake\-gui(1)\fP, or via the \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR\fP
environment variable.
.SS CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE
.sp
New in version 3.11.

.sp
Generator\-specific instance specification provided by user.
.sp
Some CMake generators support selection of an instance of the native build
system when multiple instances are available.  If the user specifies an
instance (e.g. by setting this cache entry or via the
\fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE\fP environment variable), or after a default
instance is chosen when a build tree is first configured, the value will be
available in this variable.
.sp
The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.
A toolchain file specified by the \fI\%CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\fP
variable may initialize \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE\fP as a cache entry.
Once a given build tree has been initialized with a particular value
for this variable, changing the value has undefined behavior.
.sp
Instance specification is supported only on specific generators.
.SS Visual Studio Instance Selection
.sp
\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP support instance specification for
Visual Studio 2017 and above.  The \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE\fP variable
may be set as a cache entry selecting an instance of Visual Studio
via one of the following forms:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

End a link line such that static system libraries are used.
.sp
Some linkers support switches such as \fB\-Bstatic\fP and \fB\-Bdynamic\fP to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for \fB\-lXXX\fP options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the
end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker
search type to \fB\-Bstatic\fP regardless of how it started.
.sp
This variable is used to initialize the target property
\fI\%LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC\fP for all targets. If set, its
value is also used by the \fI\%try_compile()\fP command.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
.sp
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.
.sp
Some linkers support switches such as \fB\-Bstatic\fP and \fB\-Bdynamic\fP to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for \fB\-lXXX\fP options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is
assumed to be \fB\-Bdynamic\fP at the beginning of the library list.  This
property switches the assumption to \fB\-Bstatic\fP\&.  It is intended for use
when linking an executable statically (e.g.  with the GNU \fB\-static\fP
option).
.sp
This variable is used to initialize the target property
\fI\%LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC\fP for all targets.  If set, its
value is also used by the \fI\%try_compile()\fP command.

These generators store \fBCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM\fP in the CMake cache
so that it may be edited by the user.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fI\%Ninja\fP generator sets this to \fBninja\fP\&.
.sp
This generator stores \fBCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM\fP in the CMake cache
so that it may be edited by the user.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fI\%Xcode\fP generator sets this to \fBxcodebuild\fP\&.
.sp
This generator prefers to lookup the build tool at build time
rather than to store \fBCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM\fP in the CMake cache
ahead of time.  This is because \fBxcodebuild\fP is easy to find.
.sp
For compatibility with versions of CMake prior to 3.2, if
a user or project explicitly adds \fBCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM\fP to
the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP set this to the full path to
\fBMSBuild.exe\fP (VS >= 10), \fBdevenv.com\fP (VS 7,8,9), or
\fBVCExpress.exe\fP (VS Express 8,9).
(See also variables
\fI\%CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND\fP\&.
.sp
These generators prefer to lookup the build tool at build time
rather than to store \fBCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM\fP in the CMake cache
ahead of time.  This is because the tools are version\-specific
and can be located using the Windows Registry.  It is also
necessary because the proper build tool may depend on the
project content (e.g. the Intel Fortran plugin to VS 10 and 11
requires \fBdevenv.com\fP to build its \fB\&.vfproj\fP project files
even though \fBMSBuild.exe\fP is normally preferred to support
the \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP).
.sp
For compatibility with versions of CMake prior to 3.0, if
a user or project explicitly adds \fBCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM\fP to
the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value if
possible.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fI\%Green Hills MULTI\fP generator sets this to the full

library search path is modified to look for 64\-bit libraries first.
.SS CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RULES
.sp
Whether to disable generation of installation rules.
.sp
If \fBTRUE\fP, CMake will neither generate installation rules nor
will it generate \fBcmake_install.cmake\fP files. This variable is \fBFALSE\fP by
default.
.SS CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH
.sp
If true, do not add run time path information.
.sp
If this is set to \fBTRUE\fP, then the rpath information is not added to
compiled executables.  The default is to add rpath information if the
platform supports it.  This allows for easy running from the build
tree.  To omit RPATH in the install step, but not the build step, use
\fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH\fP instead. To omit RPATH in the build step,
use \fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH\fP\&.
.sp
For more information on RPATH handling see the \fI\%INSTALL_RPATH\fP

.SS CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
.sp
The path to the top level of the source tree.
.sp
This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source
tree.  For an in\-source build, this would be the same as
\fI\%CMAKE_BINARY_DIR\fP\&.
.sp
When run in \fI\%cmake \-P\fP script mode, CMake sets the variables
\fI\%CMAKE_BINARY_DIR\fP, \fBCMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR\fP to the current working directory.

.SS CMAKE_Swift_COMPILATION_MODE
.sp
New in version 3.29.

.sp
Specify how Swift compiles a target. This variable is used to initialize the
\fI\%Swift_COMPILATION_MODE\fP property on targets as they are created.
.sp
The allowed values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBincremental\fP
Compiles each Swift source in the module separately, resulting in better
parallelism in the build. The compiler emits additional information into
the build directory improving rebuild performance when small changes are made
to the source between rebuilds. This is the best option to use while
iterating on changes in a project.
.TP
.B \fBwholemodule\fP
Whole\-module optimizations are slowest to compile, but results in the most
optimized library. The entire context is loaded into once instance of the
compiler, so there is no parallelism across source files in the module.
.TP
.B \fBsinglefile\fP
Compiles each source in a Swift modules separately, resulting in better
parallelism. Unlike the \fBincremental\fP build mode, no additional information
is emitted by the compiler during the build, so rebuilding after making small
changes to the source file will not run faster. This option should be used
sparingly, preferring \fBincremental\fP builds, unless working around a compiler
bug.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use \fI\%generator expressions\fP to support
per\-configuration specification. For example, the code:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.ft C
set(CMAKE_Swift_COMPILATION_MODE
  \(dq$<IF:$<CONFIG:Release>,wholemodule,incremental>\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
sets the default Swift compilation mode to wholemodule mode when building a
release configuration and to incremental mode in other configurations.
.sp
If this variable is not set then the \fI\%Swift_COMPILATION_MODE\fP target
property will not be set automatically. If that property is unset then CMake
uses the default value \fBincremental\fP to build the Swift source files.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This property only has effect when policy \fI\%CMP0157\fP is set to \fBNEW\fP

property on all the targets.  See the target property for additional
information.
.SS CMAKE_Swift_NUM_THREADS
.sp
New in version 3.15.1.

.sp
Number of threads for parallel compilation for Swift targets.
.sp
This variable controls the number of parallel jobs that the swift driver creates
for building targets.  If not specified, it will default to the number of
logical CPUs on the host.
.SS CMAKE_TEST_LAUNCHER
.sp
New in version 3.29.

.sp
This variable is used to initialize the \fI\%TEST_LAUNCHER\fP target
property of executable targets as they are created.  It is used to specify
a launcher for running tests, added by the \fI\%add_test()\fP command,
that run an executable target.
.sp
If this variable contains a \fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP, then the first value is the command and remaining values are its
arguments.
.sp
This variable can be initialized via an
\fI\%CMAKE_TEST_LAUNCHER\fP environment variable.
.SS CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE
.sp
Path to toolchain file supplied to \fI\%cmake(1)\fP\&.
.sp
This variable is specified on the command line when cross\-compiling with CMake.
It is the path to a file which is read early in the CMake run and which
specifies locations for compilers and toolchain utilities, and other target
platform and compiler related information.
.sp
Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted first as relative to the
build directory, and if not found, relative to the source directory.
.sp
This is initialized by the \fI\%CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\fP environment
variable if it is set when a new build tree is first created.
.sp
See the \fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES\fP variable for setting
other things not directly related to the toolchain.
.SS CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION

in their local build tree to get more verbose output from
Makefile builds and show each command line as it is launched.
.SS CMAKE_VERSION
.sp
The CMake version string as three non\-negative integer components
separated by \fB\&.\fP and possibly followed by \fB\-\fP and other information.
The first two components represent the feature level and the third
component represents either a bug\-fix level or development date.
.sp
Release versions and release candidate versions of CMake use the format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<major>.<minor>.<patch>[\-rc<n>]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

CMake versions 2.8.2 through 2.8.12 used three components for the
feature level.  Release versions represented the bug\-fix level in a
fourth component, i.e. \fB<major>.<minor>.<patch>[.<tweak>][\-rc<n>]\fP\&.
Development versions represented the development date in the fourth
component, i.e. \fB<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<date>[\-<id>]\fP\&.
.sp
CMake versions prior to 2.8.2 used three components for the
feature level and had no bug\-fix component.  Release versions
used an even\-valued second component, i.e.
\fB<major>.<even\-minor>.<patch>[\-rc<n>]\fP\&.  Development versions
used an odd\-valued second component with the development date as
the third component, i.e. \fB<major>.<odd\-minor>.<date>\fP\&.

.SS CMAKE_VS_NUGET_PACKAGE_RESTORE
.sp
New in version 3.23.

.sp
When using a Visual Studio generator, this cache variable controls
if msbuild should automatically attempt to restore NuGet packages
prior to a build. NuGet packages can be defined using the
\fI\%VS_PACKAGE_REFERENCES\fP property on a target. If no
package references are defined, this setting will do nothing.
.sp
The command line option \fB\-\-resolve\-package\-references\fP can be used
alternatively to control the resolve behavior globally. This option
will take precedence over the cache variable.
.sp
Targets that use the \fI\%DOTNET_SDK\fP are required to run a
restore before building. Disabling this option may cause the build
to fail in such projects.
.sp
This setting is stored as a cache entry. Default value is \fBON\fP\&.

.SS CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_VERSION
.sp
New in version 3.12.

.sp
Visual Studio Platform Toolset version.
.sp
The \fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP for VS 2017 and above allow to
select minor versions of the same toolset. The toolset version number

Visual Studio target framework version.
.sp
In some cases, the \fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP may use an explicit value
for the MSBuild \fBTargetFrameworkVersion\fP setting in \fB\&.csproj\fP files.
CMake provides the chosen value in this variable.
.sp
See the \fI\%CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION\fP variable
and \fI\%DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION\fP target property to
specify custom \fBTargetFrameworkVersion\fP values for project targets.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_TARGETS_VERSION\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES
.sp
New in version 3.30.

.sp
Indicate to \fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP what configurations are considered
debug configurations.  This controls the \fBUseDebugLibraries\fP setting in
each configuration of a \fB\&.vcxproj\fP file.
.sp
The \(dqUse Debug Libraries\(dq setting in Visual Studio projects, despite its
specific\-sounding name, is a general\-purpose indicator of what configurations
are considered debug configurations.  In standalone projects, this may affect
MSBuild\(aqs default selection of MSVC runtime library, optimization flags,
runtime checks, and similar settings.  In CMake projects those settings are
typically generated explicitly based on the project\(aqs specification, e.g.,
the MSVC runtime library is controlled by \fI\%CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY\fP\&.  However,
the \fBUseDebugLibraries\fP indicator is useful for reference by both humans
and tools, and may also affect the behavior of platform\-specific SDKs.
.sp
Set \fBCMAKE_VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES\fP to a true or false value to indicate whether
each configuration is considered a debug configuration.  The value may also
be the empty string (\fB\(dq\(dq\fP) in which case no \fBUseDebugLibraries\fP will be
added explicitly by CMake, and MSBuild will use its default value, \fBfalse\fP\&.
.sp
Use \fI\%generator expressions\fP
for per\-configuration specification.  For example, the code:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(CMAKE_VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES \(dq$<CONFIG:Debug,Custom>\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
indicates that all following targets consider their \(dqDebug\(dq and \(dqCustom\(dq
configurations to be debug configurations, and their other configurations
to be non\-debug configurations.
.sp
This variable is used to initialize the \fI\%VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES\fP
property on all targets as they are created.  It is also propagated by
calls to the \fI\%try_compile()\fP command into its test project.
.sp
If this variable is not set then the \fI\%VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES\fP
property will not be set automatically.  If that property is not set then
CMake generates \fBUseDebugLibraries\fP using heuristics to determine which
configurations are debug configurations.  See policy \fI\%CMP0162\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_VS_VERSION_BUILD_NUMBER
.sp
New in version 3.26.

.sp
Visual Studio version.
.sp
\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP for VS 2017 and above set this
variable to the Visual Studio version build number in the format
\fB<major>.<minor>.<date>.<build>\fP\&.
.sp
The components are:
.sp
\fB<major>.<minor>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The VS major and minor version numbers.
These are the same as the release version numbers.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB<date>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A build date in the format \fBMMMDD\fP, where \fBMMM\fP is a month index
since an epoch used by Microsoft, and \fBDD\fP is a day in that month.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB<build>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A build index on the day represented by \fB<date>\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The build number is reported by \fBvswhere\fP as \fBinstallationVersion\fP\&.
For example, VS 16.11.10 has build number \fB16.11.32126.315\fP\&.
.sp
See also the \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE\fP variable.
.SS CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_MIN_VERSION
.sp
New in version 3.27.

.sp
Tell \fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP to use the given
Windows Target Platform Minimum Version.
.sp
This variable is used to initialize the
\fI\%VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_MIN_VERSION\fP property on all
targets when they are created.  See that target property for
additional information.
.SS CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION
.sp
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Visual Studio Windows Target Platform Version.
.sp
When targeting Windows 10 and above, \fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP for
VS 2015 and above support specification of a Windows SDK version:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If \fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM\fP specifies a \fBversion=\fP field,
as documented by \fI\%Visual Studio Platform Selection\fP, that SDK
version is selected.
.IP \(bu 2
Otherwise, if the \fBWindowsSDKVersion\fP environment variable
is set to an available SDK version, that version is selected.
This is intended for use in environments established by \fBvcvarsall.bat\fP
or similar scripts.
.sp
New in version 3.27: This is enabled by policy \fI\%CMP0149\fP\&.

.IP \(bu 2
Otherwise, if \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP is set to an available
SDK version, that version is selected.
.sp
Changed in version 3.27: This is disabled by policy \fI\%CMP0149\fP\&.

.IP \(bu 2
Otherwise, CMake uses the latest Windows SDK version available.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The chosen Windows target version number is provided
in \fBCMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION\fP\&.  If no Windows 10 SDK
is available this value will be empty.
.sp
One may set a \fBCMAKE_WINDOWS_KITS_10_DIR\fP \fIenvironment variable\fP
to an absolute path to tell CMake to look for Windows 10 SDKs in
a custom location.  The specified directory is expected to contain
\fBInclude/10.0.*\fP directories.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM
.sp
New in version 3.19.

.sp
Override the \fI\%Windows 10 SDK Maximum Version for VS 2015\fP and beyond.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM\fP variable may
be set to a false value (e.g. \fBOFF\fP, \fBFALSE\fP, or \fB0\fP) or the SDK version
to use as the maximum (e.g. \fB10.0.14393.0\fP).  If unset, the default depends
on which version of Visual Studio is targeted by the current generator.
.sp
This can be used to exclude Windows SDK versions from consideration for
\fI\%CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_XCODE_BUILD_SYSTEM
.sp
New in version 3.19.

.sp
Xcode build system selection.
.sp
The \fI\%Xcode\fP generator defines this variable to indicate which
variant of the Xcode build system will be used.  The value is the
version of Xcode in which the corresponding build system first became
mature enough for use by CMake.  The possible values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB1\fP
The original Xcode build system.
This is the default when using Xcode 11.x or below and supported
up to Xcode 13.x.
.TP
.B \fB12\fP
The Xcode \(dqnew build system\(dq introduced by Xcode 10.
It became mature enough for use by CMake in Xcode 12.
This is the default when using Xcode 12.x or above.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_XCODE_BUILD_SYSTEM\fP variable is informational and should not
be modified by project code.  See the \fI\%Toolset and Build System Selection\fP
documentation section to select the Xcode build system.
.SS CMAKE_XCODE_PLATFORM_TOOLSET
.sp
Xcode compiler selection.
.sp
\fI\%Xcode\fP supports selection of a compiler from one of the installed
toolsets.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
variable, if any is explicitly selected (e.g.  via the \fI\%cmake \-T\fP
option).
.SS <PROJECT\-NAME>_BINARY_DIR
.sp
Top level binary directory for the named project.
.sp
A variable is created with the name used in the \fI\%project()\fP command,
and is the binary directory for the project.  This can be useful when
\fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP is used to connect several projects.
.SS <PROJECT\-NAME>_DESCRIPTION
.sp
New in version 3.12.

.sp
Value given to the \fBDESCRIPTION\fP option of the most recent call to the

New in version 3.21.

.sp
A boolean variable indicating whether the named project was called in a top
level \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file.
.sp
To obtain the value from the most recent call to \fI\%project()\fP in
the current directory scope or above, see the
\fI\%PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL\fP variable.
.sp
The variable value will be true in:
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.SS <PROJECT\-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR
.sp
Top level source directory for the named project.
.sp
A variable is created with the name used in the \fI\%project()\fP command,
and is the source directory for the project.  This can be useful when
\fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP is used to connect several projects.
.SS <PROJECT\-NAME>_VERSION
.sp
Value given to the \fBVERSION\fP option of the most recent call to the
\fI\%project()\fP command with project name \fB<PROJECT\-NAME>\fP, if any.
.sp
See also the component\-wise version variables
\fI\%<PROJECT\-NAME>_VERSION_MAJOR\fP,

This is the binary directory of the most recent \fI\%project()\fP command.
.SS PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
.sp
New in version 3.9.

.sp
Short project description given to the project command.
.sp
This is the description given to the most recently called \fI\%project()\fP
command in the current directory scope or above.  To obtain the description
of the top level project, see the \fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION\fP
variable.
.SS PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL
.sp
New in version 3.12.

.sp
The homepage URL of the project.
.sp
This is the homepage URL given to the most recently called \fI\%project()\fP
command in the current directory scope or above.  To obtain the homepage URL
of the top level project, see the \fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL\fP
variable.
.SS PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL
.sp
New in version 3.21.

.sp
A boolean variable indicating whether the most recently called
\fI\%project()\fP command in the current scope or above was in the top
level \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file.
.sp
Some modules should only be included as part of the top level
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file to not cause unintended side effects in the build
tree, and this variable can be used to conditionally execute such code. For
example, consider the \fI\%CTest\fP module, which creates targets and
options:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
project(MyProject)
\&...
if(PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL)

.UNINDENT
.SS PROJECT_NAME
.sp
Name of the project given to the project command.
.sp
This is the name given to the most recently called \fI\%project()\fP
command in the current directory scope or above.  To obtain the name of
the top level project, see the \fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME\fP variable.
.SS PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
.sp
This is the source directory of the last call to the
\fI\%project()\fP command made in the current directory scope or one
of its parents. Note, it is not affected by calls to
\fI\%project()\fP made within a child directory scope (i.e. from
within a call to \fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP from the current scope).
.SS PROJECT_VERSION
.sp
Value given to the \fBVERSION\fP option of the most recent call to the
\fI\%project()\fP command, if any.
.sp
See also the component\-wise version variables
\fI\%PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR\fP,
\fI\%PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR\fP,
\fI\%PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH\fP, and

.sp
Fourth version number component of the \fI\%PROJECT_VERSION\fP
variable as set by the \fI\%project()\fP command.
.SH VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR
.SS BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
.sp
Tell \fI\%add_library()\fP to default to \fBSHARED\fP libraries,
instead of \fBSTATIC\fP libraries, when called with no explicit library type.
.sp
Calls to \fI\%add_library()\fP without any explicit library type check
the current \fBBUILD_SHARED_LIBS\fP variable value.  If it is true, then the
default library type is \fBSHARED\fP\&.  Otherwise, the default is \fBSTATIC\fP\&.
.sp
For example, the code:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(example ${sources})
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
behaves as if written
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)
  add_library(example SHARED ${sources})
else()
  add_library(example STATIC ${sources})
endif()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CMake does not define \fBBUILD_SHARED_LIBS\fP by default, but projects
often create a cache entry for it using the \fI\%option()\fP command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS \(dqBuild using shared libraries\(dq ON)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This provides a switch that users can control, e.g., with \fI\%cmake \-D\fP\&.
If adding such an option to the project, do so in the top level
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file, before any \fI\%add_library()\fP calls.
Note that if bringing external dependencies directly into the build, such as
with \fI\%FetchContent\fP or a direct call to \fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP,
and one of those dependencies has such a call to
\fI\%option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ...)\fP, the top level project must
also call \fI\%option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ...)\fP before bringing in
its dependencies.  Failure to do so can lead to different behavior between the
first and subsequent CMake runs.
.SS CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
.sp
List of files which have been installed using an \fBABSOLUTE DESTINATION\fP path.
.sp
This variable is defined by CMake\-generated \fBcmake_install.cmake\fP
scripts.  It can be used (read\-only) by programs or scripts that
source those install scripts.  This is used by some CPack generators
(e.g.  RPM).
.SS CMAKE_ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND_DEPENDS_EXPLICIT_ONLY
.sp
New in version 3.27.

.sp
Whether to enable the \fBDEPENDS_EXPLICIT_ONLY\fP option by default in
\fI\%add_custom_command()\fP\&.
.sp
This variable affects the default behavior of the \fI\%add_custom_command()\fP
command.  Setting this variable to \fBON\fP is equivalent to using the
\fBDEPENDS_EXPLICIT_ONLY\fP option in all uses of that command.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH
.sp
\fI\%Semicolon\-separated list\fP of directories specifying a search path
for macOS application bundles used by the \fI\%find_program()\fP, and
\fI\%find_package()\fP commands.
.sp
There is also an environment variable \fI\%CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH\fP, which is used
as an additional list of search directories.
.SS CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
.sp
Specifies the build type on single\-configuration generators (e.g.
\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP or \fI\%Ninja\fP).  Typical values include
\fBDebug\fP, \fBRelease\fP, \fBRelWithDebInfo\fP and \fBMinSizeRel\fP, but custom
build types can also be defined.
.sp
This variable is initialized by the first \fI\%project()\fP or
\fI\%enable_language()\fP command called in a project when a new build
tree is first created.  If the \fI\%CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\fP environment
variable is set, its value is used.  Otherwise, a toolchain\-specific
default is chosen when a language is enabled.  The default value is often
an empty string, but this is usually not desirable and one of the other
standard build types is usually more appropriate.
.sp
Depending on the situation, the value of this variable may be treated
case\-sensitively or case\-insensitively.  See \fI\%Build Configurations\fP
for discussion of this and other related topics.
.sp
For multi\-config generators, see \fI\%CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_CLANG_VFS_OVERLAY
.sp
New in version 3.19.

.sp
When cross compiling for windows with clang\-cl, this variable can be an
absolute path pointing to a clang virtual file system yaml file, which
will enable clang\-cl to resolve windows header names on a case sensitive
file system.
.SS CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_COMPILER_ID
.sp
New in version 3.11.

.sp
Change the compiler id in the generated CodeBlocks project files.
.sp
CodeBlocks uses its own compiler id string which differs from
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID\fP\&.  If this variable is left empty,
CMake tries to recognize the CodeBlocks compiler id automatically.
Otherwise the specified string is used in the CodeBlocks project file.
See the CodeBlocks documentation for valid compiler id strings.
.sp
Other IDEs like QtCreator that also use the CodeBlocks generator may ignore
this setting.
.SS CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_EXCLUDE_EXTERNAL_FILES
.sp
New in version 3.10.

.sp
Change the way the CodeBlocks generator creates project files.
.sp
If this variable evaluates to \fBON\fP the generator excludes from
the project file any files that are located outside the project root.
.SS CMAKE_CODELITE_USE_TARGETS
.sp
New in version 3.7.

.sp
Change the way the CodeLite generator creates projectfiles.
.sp
If this variable evaluates to \fBON\fP at the end of the top\-level
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file, the generator creates projectfiles based on targets
rather than projects.
.SS CMAKE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
New in version 3.24.

.sp
Enable color diagnostics throughout.
.sp
This variable uses three states: \fBON\fP, \fBOFF\fP and not defined.
.sp
When not defined:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP initialize the \fI\%CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE\fP
variable to \fBON\fP\&.  It controls color buildsystem messages.
.IP \(bu 2
GNU/Clang compilers are not invoked with any color diagnostics flag.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When \fBON\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP produce color buildsystem messages by default.
\fI\%CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE\fP is not initialized, but may be
explicitly set to \fBOFF\fP to disable color buildsystem messages.
.IP \(bu 2
GNU/Clang compilers are invoked with a flag enabling color diagnostics
(\fB\-fcolor\-diagnostics\fP).
.UNINDENT
.sp
When \fBOFF\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP do not produce color buildsystem messages by
default.  \fI\%CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE\fP is not initialized, but may be
explicitly set to \fBON\fP to enable color buildsystem messages.
.IP \(bu 2
GNU/Clang compilers are invoked with a flag disabling color diagnostics
(\fB\-fno\-color\-diagnostics\fP).
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the \fI\%CMAKE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS\fP environment variable is set, its
value is used.  Otherwise, \fBCMAKE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS\fP is not defined by
default.
.SS CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE
.sp
Enables color output when using the \fI\%Makefile Generators\fP\&.
.sp
When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output.
Default is \fBON\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
.sp
Specifies the available build types (configurations) on multi\-config
generators (e.g. \fI\%Visual Studio\fP,
\fI\%Xcode\fP, or \fI\%Ninja Multi\-Config\fP) as a
\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\&.  Typical entries
include \fBDebug\fP, \fBRelease\fP, \fBRelWithDebInfo\fP and \fBMinSizeRel\fP,
but custom build types can also be defined.
.sp
This variable is initialized by the first \fI\%project()\fP or
\fI\%enable_language()\fP command called in a project when a new build
tree is first created.  If the \fI\%CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES\fP
environment variable is set, its value is used.  Otherwise, the default
value is generator\-specific.
.sp
Depending on the situation, the values in this variable may be treated
case\-sensitively or case\-insensitively.  See \fI\%Build Configurations\fP
for discussion of this and other related topics.
.sp
For single\-config generators, see \fI\%CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_DEPENDS_IN_PROJECT_ONLY
.sp
New in version 3.6.

.sp
When set to \fBTRUE\fP in a directory, the build system produced by the
\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP is set up to only consider dependencies on source
files that appear either in the source or in the binary directories.  Changes
to source files outside of these directories will not cause rebuilds.
.sp
This should be used carefully in cases where some source files are picked up
through external headers during the build.
.SS CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>
.sp
Variable for disabling \fI\%find_package()\fP calls.
.sp
Every non\-\fBREQUIRED\fP \fI\%find_package()\fP call in a project can be
disabled by setting the variable
\fBCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>\fP to \fBTRUE\fP\&.
This can be used to build a project without an optional package,
although that package is installed.
.sp
This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.  Otherwise if
the package has already been found in a previous CMake run, the
variables which have been stored in the cache will still be there.  In
that case it is recommended to remove the cache variables for this
package from the cache using the cache editor or \fI\%cmake \-U\fP\&.
.sp
Note that this variable can lead to inconsistent results within the project.
Consider the case where a dependency is requested via \fI\%find_package()\fP
from two different places within the project.  If the first call does not
have the \fBREQUIRED\fP keyword, it will not find the dependency when
\fBCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>\fP is set to true for that
dependency.  The project will proceed under the assumption that the dependency
isn\(aqt available.  If the second call elsewhere in the project \fIdoes\fP have the
\fBREQUIRED\fP keyword, it can succeed.  Two different parts of the same project
have then seen opposite results for the same dependency.
.sp
See also the \fI\%CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>\fP variable.
.SS CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_LINKED_RESOURCES
.sp
New in version 3.6.

.sp
This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
\fI\%cmake\-generators(7)\fP\&.
.sp
The Eclipse project generator generates so\-called linked resources
e.g. to the subproject root dirs in the source tree or to the source files
of targets.
This can be disabled by setting this variable to FALSE.
.SS CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT
.sp
New in version 3.6.

.sp
This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
\fI\%cmake\-generators(7)\fP\&.
.sp
If this variable is set to TRUE, the Eclipse project generator will generate
an Eclipse project in \fI\%CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\fP . This project can then
be used in Eclipse e.g. for the version control functionality.
\fBCMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT\fP defaults to \fBFALSE\fP; so
nothing is written into the source directory.
.SS CMAKE_ECLIPSE_MAKE_ARGUMENTS
.sp
New in version 3.6.

.sp
This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
\fI\%cmake\-generators(7)\fP\&.
.sp
This variable holds arguments which are used when Eclipse invokes the make
tool. By default it is initialized to hold flags to enable parallel builds
(using \-j typically).
.SS CMAKE_ECLIPSE_RESOURCE_ENCODING
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
This cache variable tells the \fI\%Eclipse CDT4\fP project generator
to set the resource encoding to the given value in generated project files.
If no value is given, no encoding will be set.
.SS CMAKE_ECLIPSE_VERSION
.sp
New in version 3.6.

.sp
This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
\fI\%cmake\-generators(7)\fP\&.
.sp
When using the Eclipse project generator, CMake tries to find the Eclipse
executable and detect the version of it. Depending on the version it finds,
some features are enabled or disabled. If CMake doesn\(aqt find
Eclipse, it assumes the oldest supported version, Eclipse Callisto (3.2).
.SS CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED
.sp
Whether to issue errors for deprecated functionality.
.sp
If \fBTRUE\fP, use of deprecated functionality will issue fatal errors.
If this variable is not set, CMake behaves as if it were set to \fBFALSE\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
.sp
Ask \fBcmake_install.cmake\fP script to error out as soon as a file with
absolute \fBINSTALL DESTINATION\fP is encountered.
.sp
The fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offending
file takes place.  This variable is used by CMake\-generated
\fBcmake_install.cmake\fP scripts.  If one sets this variable to \fBON\fP while
running the script, it may get fatal error messages from the script.
.SS CMAKE_EXECUTE_PROCESS_COMMAND_ECHO
.sp
New in version 3.15.

.sp
If this variable is set to \fBSTDERR\fP, \fBSTDOUT\fP or \fBNONE\fP then commands
in \fI\%execute_process()\fP calls will be printed to either stderr or
stdout or not at all.
.SS CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS
.sp
New in version 3.5.

.sp
Enable/Disable output of compile commands during generation.
.sp
If enabled, generates a \fBcompile_commands.json\fP file containing the exact
compiler calls for all translation units of the project in machine\-readable
form.  The format of the JSON file looks like:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
.sp
New in version 3.15.

.sp
Enables the \fI\%export(PACKAGE)\fP command when \fI\%CMP0090\fP
is set to \fBNEW\fP\&.
.sp
The \fI\%export(PACKAGE)\fP command does nothing by default.  In some cases
it is desirable to write to the user package registry, so the
\fBCMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP variable may be set to enable it.
.sp
If \fI\%CMP0090\fP is \fInot\fP set to \fBNEW\fP this variable does nothing, and
the \fI\%CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP variable controls the behavior
instead.
.sp
See also \fI\%Disabling the Package Registry\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
Disable the \fI\%export(PACKAGE)\fP command when \fI\%CMP0090\fP
is not set to \fBNEW\fP\&.
.sp
In some cases, for example for packaging and for system wide
installations, it is not desirable to write the user package registry.
If the \fBCMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP variable is enabled,
the \fI\%export(PACKAGE)\fP command will do nothing.
.sp
If \fI\%CMP0090\fP is set to \fBNEW\fP this variable does nothing, and the
\fI\%CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP variable controls the behavior
instead.
.sp

.SS CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE
.sp
New in version 3.4.

.sp
This variable affects how \fBfind_*\fP commands choose between
macOS Application Bundles and unix\-style package components.
.sp
On Darwin or systems supporting macOS Application Bundles, the
\fBCMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE\fP variable can be set to empty or
one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBFIRST\fP
Try to find application bundles before standard programs.
This is the default on Darwin.
.TP
.B \fBLAST\fP
Try to find application bundles after standard programs.
.TP
.B \fBONLY\fP
Only try to find application bundles.
.TP
.B \fBNEVER\fP
Never try to find application bundles.
.UNINDENT
.SS CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK
.sp
New in version 3.4.

.sp
This variable affects how \fBfind_*\fP commands choose between
macOS Frameworks and unix\-style package components.
.sp
On Darwin or systems supporting macOS Frameworks, the
\fBCMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK\fP variable can be set to empty or
one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBFIRST\fP
Try to find frameworks before standard libraries or headers.
This is the default on Darwin.
.TP
.B \fBLAST\fP

.SS CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX
.sp
New in version 3.9.

.sp
Specify a \fB<suffix>\fP to tell the \fI\%find_library()\fP command to
search in a \fBlib<suffix>\fP directory before each \fBlib\fP directory that
would normally be searched.
.sp
This overrides the behavior of related global properties:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS\fP

\fI\%FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES
.sp
Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.
.sp
This specifies what prefixes to add to library names when the
\fI\%find_library()\fP command looks for libraries.  On UNIX systems this is
typically \fBlib\fP, meaning that when trying to find the \fBfoo\fP library it
will look for \fBlibfoo\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
.sp
Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.
.sp
This specifies what suffixes to add to library names when the
\fI\%find_library()\fP command looks for libraries.  On Windows systems this
is typically \fB\&.lib\fP and, depending on the compiler, \fB\&.dll.lib\fP, \fB\&.dll.a\fP,
\fB\&.a\fP (e.g. rustc, GCC, or Clang), so when it tries to find the \fBfoo\fP
library, it will look for \fB[<prefix>]foo[.dll].lib\fP and/or
\fB[<prefix>]foo[.dll].a\fP, depending on the compiler used and the \fB<prefix>\fP
specified in the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX
.sp
Exclude the values of the \fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX\fP variables from
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH\fP\&.  CMake adds these project\-destination
prefixes to \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH\fP by default in order to
support building a series of dependent packages and installing them into
a common prefix.  Set \fBCMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP to \fBTRUE\fP
to suppress this behavior.
.sp
The \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH\fP is initialized on the first call to a
\fI\%project()\fP or \fI\%enable_language()\fP command.  Therefore one must
set \fBCMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP before this in order to take effect.  A
user may set the variable as a cache entry on the command line to achieve this.
.sp
Note that the prefix(es) may still be searched for other reasons, such as being
the same prefix as the CMake installation, or for being a built\-in system
prefix.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG
.sp
New in version 3.15.

.sp
Tell \fI\%find_package()\fP to try \(dqConfig\(dq mode before \(dqModule\(dq mode if no
mode was specified.
.sp
The command \fI\%find_package()\fP operates without an explicit mode when
the reduced signature is used without the \fBMODULE\fP option. In this case,
by default, CMake first tries Module mode by searching for a
\fBFind<pkg>.cmake\fP module.  If it fails, CMake then searches for the package
using Config mode.
.sp
Set \fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG\fP to \fBTRUE\fP to tell
\fI\%find_package()\fP to first search using Config mode before falling back
to Module mode.
.sp
This variable may be useful when a developer has compiled a custom version of
a common library and wishes to link it to a dependent project.  If this
variable is set to \fBTRUE\fP, it would prevent a dependent project\(aqs call
to \fI\%find_package()\fP from selecting the default library located by the
system\(aqs \fBFind<pkg>.cmake\fP module before finding the developer\(aqs custom
built library.
.sp
Once this variable is set, it is the responsibility of the exported
\fB<pkg>Config.cmake\fP files to provide the same result variables as the
\fBFind<pkg>.cmake\fP modules so that dependent projects can use them
interchangeably.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS
.sp
New in version 3.14.

.sp
Set to \fBTRUE\fP to tell \fI\%find_package()\fP calls to resolve symbolic
links in the value of \fB<PackageName>_DIR\fP\&.
.sp
This is helpful in use cases where the package search path points at a
proxy directory in which symlinks to the real package locations appear.
This is not enabled by default because there are also common use cases
in which the symlinks should be preserved.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_TARGETS_GLOBAL
.sp
New in version 3.24.

.sp
Setting to \fBTRUE\fP promotes all \fI\%IMPORTED\fP targets discoverd
by \fI\%find_package()\fP to a \fBGLOBAL\fP scope.
.sp
Setting this to \fBTRUE\fP is akin to specifying \fBGLOBAL\fP
as an argument to \fI\%find_package()\fP\&.
Default value is \fBOFF\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE
.sp
Tell \fI\%find_package()\fP to warn if called without an explicit mode.
.sp
If \fI\%find_package()\fP is called without an explicit mode option
(\fBMODULE\fP, \fBCONFIG\fP, or \fBNO_MODULE\fP) and no \fBFind<pkg>.cmake\fP module
is in \fI\%CMAKE_MODULE_PATH\fP then CMake implicitly assumes that the
caller intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package
configuration file is found then the wording of the failure message
must account for both the case that the package is really missing and
the case that the project has a bug and failed to provide the intended
Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an explicit mode option
then the failure message can be more specific.
.sp
Set \fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE\fP to \fBTRUE\fP to tell
\fI\%find_package()\fP to warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This
helps developers enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to
\fI\%find_package()\fP within a project.
.sp
This variable has no effect if \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG\fP is
set to \fBTRUE\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH
.sp
\fI\%Semicolon\-separated list\fP of root paths to search on the filesystem.
.sp
This variable is most useful when cross\-compiling. CMake uses the paths in
this list as alternative roots to find filesystem items with
\fI\%find_package()\fP, \fI\%find_library()\fP etc.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE
.sp
This variable controls whether the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP are used by \fI\%find_file()\fP and \fI\%find_path()\fP\&.
.sp
If set to \fBONLY\fP, then only the roots in \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP
will be searched. If set to \fBNEVER\fP, then the roots in
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP will be ignored and only the host system
root will be used. If set to \fBBOTH\fP, then the host system paths and the
paths in \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP will be searched.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY
.sp
This variable controls whether the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP are used by \fI\%find_library()\fP\&.
.sp
If set to \fBONLY\fP, then only the roots in \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP
will be searched. If set to \fBNEVER\fP, then the roots in
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP will be ignored and only the host system
root will be used. If set to \fBBOTH\fP, then the host system paths and the
paths in \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP will be searched.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE
.sp
This variable controls whether the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP are used by \fI\%find_package()\fP\&.
.sp
If set to \fBONLY\fP, then only the roots in \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP
will be searched. If set to \fBNEVER\fP, then the roots in
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP will be ignored and only the host system
root will be used. If set to \fBBOTH\fP, then the host system paths and the
paths in \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP will be searched.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM
.sp
This variable controls whether the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP are used by \fI\%find_program()\fP\&.
.sp
If set to \fBONLY\fP, then only the roots in \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP
will be searched. If set to \fBNEVER\fP, then the roots in
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP will be ignored and only the host system
root will be used. If set to \fBBOTH\fP, then the host system paths and the
paths in \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP will be searched.

.SS CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH

\fI\%Semicolon\-separated list\fP of directories specifying a search path
for macOS frameworks used by the \fI\%find_library()\fP,
\fI\%find_package()\fP, \fI\%find_path()\fP, and \fI\%find_file()\fP
commands.
.sp
There is also an environment variable \fI\%CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH\fP, which is used
as an additional list of search directories.
.SS CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
.sp
\fI\%Semicolon\-separated list\fP of directories
to be ignored by the various \fBfind...()\fP commands.
.sp
For \fI\%find_program()\fP, \fI\%find_library()\fP, \fI\%find_file()\fP,
and \fI\%find_path()\fP, any file found in one of the listed directories
will be ignored. The listed directories do not apply recursively, so any
subdirectories to be ignored must also be explicitly listed.
\fBCMAKE_IGNORE_PATH\fP does not affect the search \fIprefixes\fP used by these
four commands. To ignore individual paths under a search prefix
(e.g. \fBbin\fP, \fBinclude\fP, \fBlib\fP, etc.), each path must be listed in
\fBCMAKE_IGNORE_PATH\fP as a full absolute path. \fI\%CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH\fP
provides a more appropriate way to ignore a whole search prefix.
.sp
\fI\%find_package()\fP is also affected by \fBCMAKE_IGNORE_PATH\fP, but only
for \fIConfig mode\fP searches. Any \fB<Name>Config.cmake\fP or
\fB<name>\-config.cmake\fP file found in one of the specified directories
will be ignored. In addition, any search \fIprefix\fP found in \fBCMAKE_IGNORE_PATH\fP
will be skipped for backward compatibility reasons, but new code should
prefer to use \fI\%CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH\fP to ignore prefixes instead.
.sp
Ignoring search locations can be useful in cross\-compiling environments where
some system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable libraries.
For example, on cross\-compiled cluster environments, this allows a user to
ignore directories containing libraries meant for the front\-end machine.
.sp
By default, \fBCMAKE_IGNORE_PATH\fP is empty. It is intended to be set by the

.sp
If \fBmake install\fP is invoked and directories are implicitly created they
get permissions set by \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS\fP

.sp
Possible values are \fBAUTO\fP, \fBSVN\fP, \fBGIT\fP, \fBHG\fP, \fBFOSSIL\fP and \fBLIST\fP\&.

When set to \fBSVN\fP, \fBGIT\fP, \fBHG\fP or \fBFOSSIL\fP, CMake will set
the generated project accordingly to Subversion, git, Mercurial
or Fossil, and Kate will then use the respective command line tool to
retrieve the list of files in the project.
When unset or set to \fBAUTO\fP, CMake will try to detect whether the
source directory is part of a git or svn checkout or not, and put the
respective entry into the project file.

.SS CMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH

New in version 3.14.

.sp
Maximum recursion depth for CMake scripts. It is intended to be set on the
command line with \fB\-DCMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH=<x>\fP, or within
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP by projects that require a large recursion depth. Projects
that set this variable should provide the user with a way to override it. For

.sp
When enabled by the \fI\%cmake \-\-log\-context\fP command line
option or the \fI\%CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW\fP variable, the
\fI\%message()\fP command converts the \fBCMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT\fP list into a
dot\-separated string surrounded by square brackets and prepends it to each line
for messages of log levels \fBNOTICE\fP and below.
.sp
For logging contexts to work effectively, projects should generally
\fBAPPEND\fP and \fBPOP_BACK\fP an item to the current value of
\fBCMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT\fP rather than replace it.
Projects should not assume the message context at the top of the source tree

Setting this variable to true enables showing a context with each line

for how the context itself is specified).
.sp
This variable is an alternative to providing the \fB\-\-log\-context\fP option

New in version 3.24.

.sp
\fI\%Semicolon\-separated list\fP of CMake language
files to include as part of the very first \fI\%project()\fP call.
The files will be included immediately after the toolchain file has been read
(if one is specified) and platform variables have been set, but before any
languages have been enabled. Therefore, language\-specific variables,
including things like \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER\fP, might not be set.
See \fI\%Code Injection\fP for a more detailed discussion of files potentially
included during a \fI\%project()\fP call.
.sp
New in version 3.29: This variable can also now refer to module names to be found in
\fI\%CMAKE_MODULE_PATH\fP or builtin to CMake.

.sp
This variable is intended for specifying files that perform one\-time setup
for the build. It provides an injection point for things like configuring
package managers, adding logic the user shares between projects (e.g. defining
their own custom build types), and so on. It is primarily for users to add
things specific to their environment, but not for specifying the toolchain
details (use \fI\%CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\fP for that).

.SS CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>
.sp
New in version 3.22.

.sp
Variable for making \fI\%find_package()\fP call \fBREQUIRED\fP\&.
.sp
Every non\-\fBREQUIRED\fP \fI\%find_package()\fP call in a project can be
turned into \fBREQUIRED\fP by setting the variable
\fBCMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>\fP to \fBTRUE\fP\&.
This can be used to assert assumptions about build environment and to
ensure the build will fail early if they do not hold.
.sp
Note that setting this variable to true breaks some commonly used patterns.
Multiple calls to \fI\%find_package()\fP are sometimes used to obtain a
different search order to the default.
For example, projects can force checking a known path for a particular
package first before searching any of the other default search paths:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
find_package(something PATHS /some/local/path NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
find_package(something)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the above, the first call looks for the \fBsomething\fP package in a specific
directory.  If \fBCMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_something\fP is set to true, then
this first call must succeed, otherwise a fatal error occurs.  The second call
never gets a chance to provide a fall\-back to using the default search
locations.
.sp
A similar pattern is used even by some of CMake\(aqs own Find modules to search
for a config package first:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
find_package(something CONFIG QUIET)
if(NOT something_FOUND)
  # Fall back to searching using typical Find module logic...
endif()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Again, if \fBCMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_something\fP is true, the first call
must succeed.  It effectively means a config package must be found for the
dependency, and the Find module logic is never used.
.sp
See also the \fI\%CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>\fP variable.
.SS CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY
.sp
Don\(aqt make the \fBinstall\fP target depend on the \fBall\fP target.
.sp
By default, the \fBinstall\fP target depends on the \fBall\fP target.  This
has the effect, that when \fBmake install\fP is invoked or \fBINSTALL\fP is
built, first the \fBall\fP target is built, then the installation starts.
If \fBCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY\fP is set to \fBTRUE\fP, this
dependency is not created, so the installation process will start immediately,
independent from whether the project has been completely built or not.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_TEST_ALL_DEPENDENCY\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_SKIP_TEST_ALL_DEPENDENCY
.sp
New in version 3.29.

.sp
Control whether the \fBtest\fP target depends on the \fBall\fP target.
.sp
If this variable is not defined, or is set to \fBTRUE\fP, then the
\fBtest\fP (or \fBRUN_TESTS\fP) target does not depend on the
\fBall\fP (or \fBALL_BUILD\fP) target.  When the \fBtest\fP target is built,
e.g., via \fBmake test\fP, the test process will start immediately,
regardless of whether the project has been completely built or not.
.sp
If \fBCMAKE_SKIP_TEST_ALL_DEPENDENCY\fP is explicitly set to \fBFALSE\fP,
then the \fBtest\fP target will depend on the \fBall\fP target.  When the
\fBtest\fP target is built, e.g., via \fBmake test\fP, the \fBall\fP target
will be built first, and then the tests will run.
.sp
See also \fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX
.sp
This variable may be set to a path to install to when cross\-compiling. This can
be useful if the path in \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP is read\-only, or otherwise
should remain pristine.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX\fP location is also used as a search prefix
by the \fBfind_*\fP commands. This can be controlled by setting the
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP variable.
.sp
If any \fBRPATH\fP/\fBRUNPATH\fP entries passed to the linker contain the
\fBCMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX\fP, the matching path fragments are replaced
with the \fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS
.sp
New in version 3.8.

\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file, the \fI\%Sublime Text 2\fP extra generator
excludes the build tree from the \fB\&.sublime\-project\fP if it is inside the
source tree.
.SS CMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION
.sp
New in version 3.12.

.sp
If \fBCMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION\fP is \fBOFF\fP, which is default, then CMake
adds a special target on which all other targets depend that checks the build
system and optionally re\-runs CMake to regenerate the build system when
the target specification source changes.
.sp
If this variable evaluates to \fBON\fP at the end of the top\-level
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file, CMake will not add the regeneration target to the
build system or perform any build system checks.
.SS CMAKE_SYSROOT
.sp
Path to pass to the compiler in the \fB\-\-sysroot\fP flag.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_SYSROOT\fP content is passed to the compiler in the \fB\-\-sysroot\fP
flag, if supported.  The path is also stripped from the \fBRPATH\fP/\fBRUNPATH\fP
if necessary on installation.  The \fBCMAKE_SYSROOT\fP is also used to prefix
paths searched by the \fBfind_*\fP commands.
.sp
This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the \fI\%CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\fP variable.
.sp
See also the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT_COMPILE\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT_LINK\fP variables.
.SS CMAKE_SYSROOT_COMPILE

Path to pass to the compiler in the \fB\-\-sysroot\fP flag when compiling source
files.  This is the same as \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP but is used only for

.sp
New in version 3.4.

Search path for macOS application bundles used by the \fI\%find_program()\fP,

directories for the current system.  It is \fInot\fP intended to be modified by
the project, use \fI\%CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH\fP for this.
.SS CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
.sp
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Search path for macOS frameworks used by the \fI\%find_library()\fP,
\fI\%find_package()\fP, \fI\%find_path()\fP, and \fI\%find_file()\fP
commands.  By default it contains the standard directories for the
current system.  It is \fInot\fP intended to be modified by the project,
use \fI\%CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH\fP for this.
.SS CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH
.sp
\fI\%Semicolon\-separated list\fP of directories
to be ignored by the various \fBfind...()\fP commands.
.sp
For \fI\%find_program()\fP, \fI\%find_library()\fP, \fI\%find_file()\fP,
and \fI\%find_path()\fP, any file found in one of the listed directories
will be ignored. The listed directories do not apply recursively, so any
subdirectories to be ignored must also be explicitly listed.
\fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH\fP does not affect the search \fIprefixes\fP used by these
four commands. To ignore individual paths under a search prefix
(e.g. \fBbin\fP, \fBinclude\fP, \fBlib\fP, etc.), each path must be listed in
\fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH\fP as a full absolute path. \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH\fP
provides a more appropriate way to ignore a whole search prefix.
.sp
\fI\%find_package()\fP is also affected by \fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH\fP, but only
for \fIConfig mode\fP searches. Any \fB<Name>Config.cmake\fP or
\fB<name>\-config.cmake\fP file found in one of the specified directories
will be ignored. In addition, any search \fIprefix\fP found in \fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH\fP
will be skipped for backward compatibility reasons, but new code should
prefer to use \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH\fP to ignore prefixes instead.
.sp
Ignoring search locations can be useful in cross\-compiling environments where
some system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable libraries.
For example, on cross\-compiled cluster environments, this allows a user to
ignore directories containing libraries meant for the front\-end machine.
.sp
\fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH\fP is populated by CMake as part of its platform
and toolchain setup. Its purpose is to ignore locations containing
incompatible binaries meant for the host rather than the target platform.
The project or end user should not modify this variable, they should use
\fI\%CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH\fP instead.

.sp
The system directories that are contained in \fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH\fP are
locations that typically include installed software. An example being
\fB/usr/local\fP for UNIX based platforms. In addition to standard platform
locations, CMake will also add values to \fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH\fP based on
environment variables. The environment variables and search locations that
CMake uses may evolve over time, as platforms and their conventions also
evolve. The following provides an indicative list of environment variables

implicit linker search path by matching the \fB<arch>\fP name.
.SS CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX
.sp
Maximum object file full\-path length allowed by native build tools.
.sp
CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is
unique to the source file and deterministic with respect to the full
path to the source file.  This allows multiple source files in a
target to share the same name if they lie in different directories
without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However, it can
produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path
using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a
limit.  CMake has a built\-in limit for each platform that is
sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may have a lower
limit.  This variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly.  The
value must be an integer no less than 128.
.SS CMAKE_SYSTEM
.sp
Composite name of operating system CMake is compiling for.
.sp
This variable is the composite of \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP, e.g.
\fB${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}\-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}\fP\&.  If
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP is not set, then this variable is
the same as \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
.sp
The name of the operating system for which CMake is to build.
See the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP variable for the OS version.
.sp
Note that \fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP is not set to anything by default when running
in script mode, since it\(aqs not building anything.
.SS System Name for Host Builds
.sp
\fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP is by default set to the same value as the
\fI\%CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME\fP variable so that the build
targets the host system.
.SS System Name for Cross Compiling
.sp
\fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP may be set explicitly when first configuring a new build
tree in order to enable \fI\%cross compiling\fP\&.
In this case the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP variable must also be
set explicitly.

MSYS2\(aqs \fBmsys/cmake\fP package (\fB/usr/bin/cmake\fP) works only under
\fBMSYSTEM=MSYS\fP environments, with system name \fBMSYS\fP\&.  Under other
environments like \fBMSYSTEM=MINGW64\fP, use another package such
as \fBmingw64/mingw\-w64\-x86_64\-cmake\fP (\fB/mingw64/bin/cmake\fP),
which targets \fBMSYSTEM=MINGW64\fP with system name \fBWindows\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Cygwin\(aqs \fBcmake\fP package (\fB/usr/bin/cmake\fP) uses system name \fBCYGWIN\fP\&.
A non\-cygwin CMake on Windows (e.g. \fB$PROGRAMFILES/CMake/bin/cmake\fP)
uses system name \fBWindows\fP even when it runs under a Cygwin environment.
.UNINDENT
.SS CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
.sp
When not cross\-compiling, this variable has the same value as the
\fI\%CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR\fP variable.  In many cases,
this will correspond to the target architecture for the build, but
this is not guaranteed.  (E.g. on Windows, the host may be \fBAMD64\fP
even when using a MSVC \fBcl\fP compiler with a 32\-bit target.)
.sp
When cross\-compiling, a \fI\%CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\fP should set
the \fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR\fP variable to match target architecture
that it specifies (via \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER\fP and perhaps
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_TARGET\fP).
.SS CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
.sp
The version of the operating system for which CMake is to build.
See the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP variable for the OS name.
.SS System Version for Host Builds
.sp
When the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP variable takes its default value
then \fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP is by default set to the same value as the
\fI\%CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP variable so that the build targets
the host system version.
.sp
In the case of a host build then \fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP may be set
explicitly when first configuring a new build tree in order to enable
targeting the build for a different version of the host operating system
than is actually running on the host.  This is allowed and not considered
cross compiling so long as the binaries built for the specified OS version
can still run on the host.
.SS System Version for Cross Compiling
.sp
When the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\fP variable is set explicitly to
enable \fI\%cross compiling\fP then the
value of \fBCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION\fP must also be set explicitly to specify
the target system version.
.SS CYGWIN

\fBTrue\fP for Cygwin.
.sp
Set to \fBtrue\fP when using Cygwin.

.SS MINGW
.sp
New in version 3.2.

.sp
Set to a true value when at least one language is enabled
with a compiler targeting the GNU ABI on Windows (MinGW).
.sp
Otherwise, this variable is not set by CMake.
.SS MSVC
.sp
Set to \fBtrue\fP when the compiler is some version of Microsoft Visual C++
or another compiler simulating the Visual C++ \fBcl\fP command\-line syntax.
.sp
See also the \fI\%MSVC_VERSION\fP variable.
.SS MSVC_IDE

configurations from \fI\%CMAKE_CROSS_CONFIGS\fP are used. If it is not
specified, it defaults to \fI\%CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE\fP\&.
.sp
For example, if you set \fI\%CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE\fP to \fBRelease\fP,
but set \fBCMAKE_DEFAULT_CONFIGS\fP to \fBDebug\fP or \fBall\fP, all
\fB<target>\fP aliases in \fBbuild.ninja\fP will resolve to \fB<target>:Debug\fP or

.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
On the linker command line, \fB<PREFIX>\fP will precede the list of libraries
in the group and \fB<SUFFIX>\fP will follow after.
.sp
For the elements of this variable, the \fBLINKER:\fP prefix can be used.
.sp
To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix and \fB,\fP separator can be used to specify, in a portable
way, options to pass to the linker tool. \fBLINKER:\fP is replaced by the
appropriate driver option and \fB,\fP by the appropriate driver separator.
The driver prefix and driver separator are given by the values of the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP\fP variables.
.sp
For example, \fB\(dqLINKER:\-z,defs\(dq\fP becomes \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fP for
\fBClang\fP and \fB\-Wl,\-z,defs\fP for \fBGNU GCC\fP\&.

.SS Solving cross\-references between two static libraries
.sp
A project may define two or more static libraries which have circular
dependencies between them.  In order for the linker to resolve all symbols
at link time, it may need to search repeatedly among the libraries until no
new undefined references are created.  Different linkers use different syntax
for achieving this.  The following example shows how this may be implemented
for some linkers.  Note that this is for illustration purposes only.
Projects should use the built\-in \fBRESCAN\fP group feature instead
(see \fI\%Predefined Features\fP), which provides a more complete and more robust
implementation of this functionality.

.SS Predefined Features
.sp
The following built\-in group features are pre\-defined by CMake:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBRESCAN\fP
Some linkers are single\-pass only.  For such linkers, circular references
between libraries typically result in unresolved symbols.  This feature
instructs the linker to search the specified static libraries repeatedly
until no new undefined references are created.
.sp
Normally, a static library is searched only once in the order that it is
specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that library is needed to
resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an object in a library that
appears later on the command line, the linker would not be able to resolve
that reference.  By grouping the static libraries with the \fBRESCAN\fP
feature, they will all be searched repeatedly until all possible references
are resolved.  This will use linker options like \fB\-\-start\-group\fP and
\fB\-\-end\-group\fP, or on SunOS, \fB\-z rescan\-start\fP and \fB\-z rescan\-end\fP\&.
.sp
Using this feature has a significant performance cost. It is best to use it
only when there are unavoidable circular references between two or more
static libraries.
.sp
This feature is available when using toolchains that target Linux, BSD, and
SunOS.  It can also be used when targeting Windows platforms if the GNU
toolchain is used.
.UNINDENT
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED
.sp
New in version 3.24.

.sp
This variable specifies whether the \fB<FEATURE>\fP is supported for the link
language \fB<LANG>\fP\&.  If this variable is true, then the \fB<FEATURE>\fP must
be defined by \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>\fP, and the
more generic \fI\%CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>\fP variables are not used.
.sp
If \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED\fP is false or is not
set, then the \fI\%CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED\fP variable
will determine whether \fB<FEATURE>\fP is deemed to be supported.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES
.sp
New in version 3.30.

.sp
This variable defines the semantics of the specified link library \fB<FEATURE>\fP
when linking with the link language \fB<LANG>\fP\&. It takes precedence over
\fI\%CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES\fP if that variable is also
defined for the same \fB<FEATURE>\fP, but otherwise has similar effects.
See \fI\%CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES\fP for further details.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Language\-specific flag to be used to link a library specified by
a path to its file.
.sp
The flag will be used before a library file path is given to the
linker.  This is needed only on very few platforms.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Flag to be used to link a library into a shared library or executable.
.sp
This flag will be used to specify a library to link to a shared library or an
executable for the specific language.  On most compilers this is \fB\-l\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_<FEATURE>
.sp
New in version 3.24.

.sp
This variable defines how to link a library or framework for the specified
\fB<FEATURE>\fP when a \fI\%LINK_LIBRARY\fP generator expression is used and
the link language for the target is \fB<LANG>\fP\&.
For this variable to have any effect, the associated
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED\fP variable
must be set to true.
.sp
The \fI\%CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_<FEATURE>\fP variable should be defined
instead for features that are independent of the link language.
.sp
Feature names are case\-sensitive and may only contain letters, numbers
and underscores.  Feature names defined in all uppercase are reserved for
CMake\(aqs own built\-in features (see \fI\%Predefined Features\fP further below).
.sp
Some aspects of feature behavior can be defined by the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES\fP variables.
.SS Feature Definitions
.sp
A library feature definition is a list that contains one or three elements:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[<PREFIX>] <LIBRARY_EXPRESSION> [<SUFFIX>]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When \fB<PREFIX>\fP and \fB<SUFFIX>\fP are specified, they precede and follow
respectively the whole list of libraries specified in the
\fI\%LINK_LIBRARY\fP expression, not each library item individually.
There is no guarantee that the list of specified libraries will be kept
grouped together though, so the \fB<PREFIX>\fP and \fB<SUFFIX>\fP may appear
more than once if the library list is reorganized by CMake to satisfy other
constraints.  This means constructs like \fB\-\-start\-group\fP and \fB\-\-end\-group\fP,
as supported by the GNU \fBld\fP linker, cannot be used in this way.  The
\fI\%LINK_GROUP\fP generator expression should be used instead for such
constructs.
.sp
\fB<LIBRARY_EXPRESSION>\fP is used to specify the pattern for constructing the
corresponding fragment on the linker command line for each library.
The following placeholders can be used in the expression:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<LIBRARY>\fP is expanded to the full path to the library for CMake targets,
or to a platform\-specific value based on the item otherwise (the same as
\fB<LINK_ITEM>\fP on Windows, or the library base name for other platforms).
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<LINK_ITEM>\fP is expanded to how the library would normally be linked on
the linker command line.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<LIB_ITEM>\fP is expanded to the full path to the library for CMake targets,
or the item itself exactly as specified in the \fB<LIBRARY_EXPRESSION>\fP
otherwise.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition to the above, it is possible to have one pattern for paths
(CMake targets and external libraries specified with file paths) and another
for other items specified by name only.  The \fBPATH{}\fP and \fBNAME{}\fP wrappers
can be used to provide the expansion for those two cases, respectively.
When wrappers are used, both must be present.  For example:

.TP
.B \fBWHOLE_ARCHIVE\fP
Force inclusion of all members of a static library.  This feature is only

.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Linux.
.IP \(bu 2
All BSD variants.

All Apple variants.  The library must be specified as a CMake target name,
a library file name (such as \fBlibfoo.a\fP), or a library file path (such as
\fB/path/to/libfoo.a\fP).  Due to a limitation of the Apple linker, it
cannot be specified as a plain library name like \fBfoo\fP, where \fBfoo\fP
is not a CMake target.
.IP \(bu 2

.B \fBFRAMEWORK\fP
This option tells the linker to search for the specified framework using
the \fB\-framework\fP linker option.  It can only be used on Apple platforms,
and only with a linker that understands the option used (i.e. the linker
provided with Xcode, or one compatible with it).
.sp
The framework can be specified as a CMake framework target, a bare framework
name, or a file path.  If a target is given, that target must have the
\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP target property set to true.  For a file path, if it
contains a directory part, that directory will be added as a framework
search path.

Note that CMake recognizes and automatically handles framework targets,
even without using the \fI\%$<LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,...>\fP expression.
The generator expression can still be used with a CMake target if the
project wants to be explicit about it, but it is not required to do so.
The linker command line may have some differences between using the
generator expression or not, but the final result should be the same.
On the other hand, if a file path is given, CMake will recognize some paths
automatically, but not all cases.  The project may want to use
\fI\%$<LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,...>\fP for file paths so that the expected
behavior is clear.
.sp

\fBFRAMEWORK\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBREEXPORT_FRAMEWORK\fP

To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix and \fB,\fP separator can be used to specify, in a portable

.SS Solving cross\-references between two static libraries
.sp
A project may define two or more static libraries which have circular
dependencies between them.  In order for the linker to resolve all symbols
at link time, it may need to search repeatedly among the libraries until no
new undefined references are created.  Different linkers use different syntax
for achieving this.  The following example shows how this may be implemented
for some linkers.  Note that this is for illustration purposes only.
Projects should use the built\-in \fBRESCAN\fP group feature instead
(see \fI\%Predefined Features\fP), which provides a more complete and more robust
implementation of this functionality.

.SS Predefined Features
.sp
The following built\-in group features are pre\-defined by CMake:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBRESCAN\fP
Some linkers are single\-pass only.  For such linkers, circular references
between libraries typically result in unresolved symbols.  This feature
instructs the linker to search the specified static libraries repeatedly
until no new undefined references are created.
.sp
Normally, a static library is searched only once in the order that it is
specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that library is needed to
resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an object in a library that
appears later on the command line, the linker would not be able to resolve
that reference.  By grouping the static libraries with the \fBRESCAN\fP
feature, they will all be searched repeatedly until all possible references
are resolved.  This will use linker options like \fB\-\-start\-group\fP and
\fB\-\-end\-group\fP, or on SunOS, \fB\-z rescan\-start\fP and \fB\-z rescan\-end\fP\&.
.sp
Using this feature has a significant performance cost. It is best to use it
only when there are unavoidable circular references between two or more
static libraries.
.sp
This feature is available when using toolchains that target Linux, BSD, and
SunOS.  It can also be used when targeting Windows platforms if the GNU
toolchain is used.
.UNINDENT
.SS CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED

New in version 3.24.

.sp
This variable specifies whether the \fB<FEATURE>\fP is supported regardless of
the link language.  If this variable is true, then the \fB<FEATURE>\fP must
be defined by \fI\%CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>\fP\&.
.sp
Note that this variable has no effect if
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED\fP is true for
the link language of the target.
.SS CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
.sp
Default value for \fI\%LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP of targets.
.sp
This variable is used to initialize the \fI\%LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.
.SS CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES
.sp
New in version 3.30.

.sp
This variable defines the behavior of the specified link library
\fB<FEATURE>\fP\&. It specifies how the \fB<FEATURE>\fP interacts with other
features, when the \fB<FEATURE>\fP should be applied, and aspects of how the
\fB<FEATURE>\fP should be handled when CMake assembles the final linker
command line (e.g. de\-duplication).
.sp
The syntax of the linker flags for the \fB<FEATURE>\fP are controlled by the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_<FEATURE>\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_<FEATURE>\fP variables.
The \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED\fP variables
control whether the \fB<FEATURE>\fP is available at all.
.sp
When linking for a particular language \fB<LANG>\fP,
\fBCMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES\fP is ignored if the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES\fP variable is also
defined for the same \fB<FEATURE>\fP\&.
.sp
The value of \fBCMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES\fP at the end of the
directory scope in which a target is defined is what matters.
.SS Feature Attributes Definition
.sp
A feature attributes definition is a
\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP of
\fBattribute=value(s)\fP items. If an attribute has multiple values, those values
must be comma\-separated.
.sp
The following attributes are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBLIBRARY_TYPE=<library\-type\-list>\fP
Specify the library types supported by the feature. Supported values are:
\fBSTATIC\fP, \fBSHARED\fP, \fBMODULE\fP, and \fBEXECUTABLE\fP\&.
.sp
If this attribute is not specified, the default is
\fBLIBRARY_TYPE=STATIC,SHARED,MODULE,EXECUTABLE\fP\&.
.sp
If the feature is used with an unsupported library type, CMake will emit a
developer warning and the feature will be ignored.
.TP
.B \fBOVERRIDE=<feature\-list>\fP
Specify which features this one replaces in the event of a conflict.
This override mechanism is superseded by
\fI\%LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE\fP or
\fI\%LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_<LIBRARY>\fP target property definitions,
if defined.
.sp
If this attribute is not specified, the default is an empty list.
.TP
.B \fBDEDUPLICATION=YES|NO|DEFAULT\fP
Specify the de\-duplication strategy for a library using this feature.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBYES\fP
The library is always de\-duplicated. The default strategy CMake would
normally apply is ignored.
.TP

A common need is the loading of a full archive as part of the creation of a

because they are compatible and enhance the user\(aqs experience: standard
library specification and \fB$<LINK_LIBRARY:WHOLE_ARCHIVE>\fP can be used
freely.
.TP
.B \fBDEDUPLICATION=YES\fP
When this feature is used, the linker loads all symbols from the static
library, so there is no need to repeat the library on the linker
command line.
.UNINDENT

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The resulting link command will only have one instance of the \fBA\fP library
specified, and the linker flags will ensure that all symbols are loaded from
the \fBA\fP library.
.SS CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG
.sp
Flag to be used to link a library specified by a path to its file.
.sp
The flag will be used before a library file path is given to the
linker.  This is needed only on very few platforms.
.SS CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG
.sp
Flag to be used to link a library into an executable.
.sp
The flag will be used to specify a library to link to an executable.
On most compilers this is \fB\-l\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_<FEATURE>
.sp
New in version 3.24.

.sp
This variable defines how to link a library or framework for the specified
\fB<FEATURE>\fP when a \fI\%LINK_LIBRARY\fP generator expression is used.
Both of the following conditions must be met for this variable to have any
effect:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The associated \fI\%CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED\fP
variable must be set to true.
.IP \(bu 2
There is no language\-specific definition for the same \fB<FEATURE>\fP\&.
This means \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_<FEATURE>_SUPPORTED\fP
cannot be true for the link language used by the target for which the
\fI\%LINK_LIBRARY\fP generator expression is evaluated.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Feature names are case\-sensitive and may only contain letters, numbers
and underscores.  Feature names defined in all uppercase are reserved for
CMake\(aqs own built\-in features (see \fI\%Predefined Features\fP further below).
.sp
Some aspects of feature behavior can be defined by the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_<FEATURE>_ATTRIBUTES\fP variables.
.SS Feature Definitions
.sp
A library feature definition is a list that contains one or three elements:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[<PREFIX>] <LIBRARY_EXPRESSION> [<SUFFIX>]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When \fB<PREFIX>\fP and \fB<SUFFIX>\fP are specified, they precede and follow
respectively the whole list of libraries specified in the
\fI\%LINK_LIBRARY\fP expression, not each library item individually.
There is no guarantee that the list of specified libraries will be kept
grouped together though, so the \fB<PREFIX>\fP and \fB<SUFFIX>\fP may appear
more than once if the library list is reorganized by CMake to satisfy other
constraints.  This means constructs like \fB\-\-start\-group\fP and \fB\-\-end\-group\fP,
as supported by the GNU \fBld\fP linker, cannot be used in this way.  The
\fI\%LINK_GROUP\fP generator expression should be used instead for such
constructs.
.sp
\fB<LIBRARY_EXPRESSION>\fP is used to specify the pattern for constructing the
corresponding fragment on the linker command line for each library.
The following placeholders can be used in the expression:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<LIBRARY>\fP is expanded to the full path to the library for CMake targets,
or to a platform\-specific value based on the item otherwise (the same as
\fB<LINK_ITEM>\fP on Windows, or the library base name for other platforms).
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<LINK_ITEM>\fP is expanded to how the library would normally be linked on
the linker command line.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<LIB_ITEM>\fP is expanded to the full path to the library for CMake targets,
or the item itself exactly as specified in the \fB<LIBRARY_EXPRESSION>\fP
otherwise.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition to the above, it is possible to have one pattern for paths
(CMake targets and external libraries specified with file paths) and another
for other items specified by name only.  The \fBPATH{}\fP and \fBNAME{}\fP wrappers
can be used to provide the expansion for those two cases, respectively.
When wrappers are used, both must be present.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0

This option tells the linker to search for the specified framework using

and only with a linker that understands the option used (i.e. the linker
provided with Xcode, or one compatible with it).
.sp
The framework can be specified as a CMake framework target, a bare framework
name, or a file path.  If a target is given, that target must have the
\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP target property set to true.  For a file path, if it
contains a directory part, that directory will be added as a framework
search path.

Note that CMake recognizes and automatically handles framework targets,
even without using the \fI\%$<LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,...>\fP expression.
The generator expression can still be used with a CMake target if the
project wants to be explicit about it, but it is not required to do so.
The linker command line may have some differences between using the
generator expression or not, but the final result should be the same.
On the other hand, if a file path is given, CMake will recognize some paths
automatically, but not all cases.  The project may want to use
\fI\%$<LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,...>\fP for file paths so that the expected
behavior is clear.

.sp
Value used to initialize the \fI\%CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>\fP
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a \fI\%toolchain file\fP\&.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

\fI\%CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
.sp
Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.
.sp
Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install RPATH.  If this variable is set to \fBTRUE\fP then the software is
always built with no RPATH.
.sp
This is used to initialize the \fI\%SKIP_BUILD_RPATH\fP target property
for all targets. For more information on RPATH handling see
the \fI\%INSTALL_RPATH\fP and \fI\%BUILD_RPATH\fP target properties.
.sp
See also the \fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH\fP variable.
To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
\fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH\fP instead.
.SS CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH
.sp
Do not include RPATHs in the install tree.
.sp
Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is enabled when
building.  This can be useful for example to allow running tests from
the build directory with RPATH enabled before the installation step.
.sp
See also the \fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH\fP variable.
To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
\fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH\fP instead.

.SS CMAKE_TASKING_TOOLSET
.sp
New in version 3.25.

.sp
Select the Tasking toolset which provides the compiler
.sp
Architecture compilers are provided by different toolchains with
incompatible versioning schemes.  Set this variable in a
\fI\%toolchain file\fP so CMake can detect
the compiler features correctly. If no toolset is specified,
\fBStandalone\fP is assumed.
.sp
Due to the different versioning schemes, the compiler version
(\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION\fP) depends on the toolset and
architecture in use. If projects can be built with multiple toolsets or
architectures, the specified \fBCMAKE_TASKING_TOOLSET\fP and the
automatically determined \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ARCHITECTURE_ID\fP
must be taken into account when comparing against the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION\fP\&.

.SS CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION
.sp
Build configuration used for \fI\%try_compile()\fP and \fI\%try_run()\fP
projects.
.sp
Projects built by \fI\%try_compile()\fP and \fI\%try_run()\fP are built
synchronously during the CMake configuration step.  Therefore a specific build
configuration must be chosen even if the generated build system
supports multiple configurations.
.SS CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_NO_PLATFORM_VARIABLES
.sp
New in version 3.24.

.sp
Set to a true value to tell the \fI\%try_compile()\fP command not
to propagate any platform variables into the test project.
.sp
The \fI\%try_compile()\fP command normally passes some CMake variables
that configure the platform and toolchain behavior into test projects.
See policy \fI\%CMP0137\fP\&.  This variable may be set to disable
that behavior.
.SS CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES
.sp
New in version 3.6.

.sp
List of variables that the \fI\%try_compile()\fP command source file signature
must propagate into the test project in order to target the same platform as
the host project.
.sp
This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by
CMake\(aqs platform information modules for the current toolchain, or by a
toolchain file when used with \fI\%CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\fP\&.
.sp
Variables meaningful to CMake, such as \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS\fP, are
propagated automatically.  The \fBCMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES\fP
variable may be set to pass custom variables meaningful to a toolchain file.
For example, a toolchain file may contain:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME ...)
set(CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE)
# ... use MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE ...

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If a user passes \fB\-DMY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE=SomeValue\fP to CMake then this
setting will be made visible to the toolchain file both for the main
project and for test projects generated by the \fI\%try_compile()\fP
command source file signature.
.sp
Changed in version 3.24: Listed variables are propagated to the \fI\%try_compile()\fP
\fI\%whole\-project\fP signature too.
See \fI\%CMP0137\fP\&.

.sp
New in version 3.24: The \fI\%CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_NO_PLATFORM_VARIABLES\fP variable may be
set to disable passing platform variables into the test project.

.SS CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE
.sp
New in version 3.6.

.sp
Type of target generated for \fI\%try_compile()\fP calls using the
source file signature.  Valid values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBEXECUTABLE\fP
Use \fI\%add_executable()\fP to name the source file in the
generated project.  This is the default if no value is given.
.TP
.B \fBSTATIC_LIBRARY\fP
Use \fI\%add_library()\fP with the \fBSTATIC\fP option to name the
source file in the generated project.  This avoids running the
linker and is intended for use with cross\-compiling toolchains
that cannot link without custom flags or linker scripts.
.UNINDENT
.SS CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
This variable is used to initialize the \fI\%UNITY_BUILD\fP
property of targets when they are created.  Setting it to true
enables batch compilation of multiple sources within each target.
This feature is known as a \fIUnity\fP or \fIJumbo\fP build.
.sp
Projects should not set this variable, it is intended as a developer
control to be set on the \fI\%cmake(1)\fP command line or other
equivalent methods.  The developer must have the ability to enable or
disable unity builds according to the capabilities of their own machine
and compiler.

.SS CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_UNIQUE_ID
.sp
New in version 3.20.

.sp
This variable is used to initialize the \fI\%UNITY_BUILD_UNIQUE_ID\fP
property of targets when they are created.  It specifies the name of the
unique identifier generated per file in a unity build.
.SS CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS
.sp
New in version 3.24.

.sp
This variable is used to initialize the
\fI\%VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS\fP property of targets when they are
created.  Setting it to true enables header set verification.
.sp
Projects should not normally set this variable, it is intended as a developer
control to be set on the \fI\%cmake(1)\fP command line or other
equivalent methods.  The developer must have the ability to enable or
disable header set verification according to the capabilities of their own
machine and compiler.
.sp
Verification of a dependency\(aqs header sets is not typically of interest
to developers.  Therefore, \fI\%FetchContent_MakeAvailable()\fP explicitly
sets \fBCMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS\fP to false for the duration of its
call, but restores its original value before returning.  If a project brings
a dependency directly into the main build (e.g. calling
\fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP on a vendored project from a git submodule), it
should also do likewise.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Save original setting so we can restore it later
set(want_header_set_verification ${CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS})

# Include the vendored dependency with header set verification disabled
set(CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS OFF)
add_subdirectory(...)   # Vendored sources, e.g. from git submodules

# Add the project\(aqs own sources. Restore the developer\(aqs original choice
# for whether to enable header set verification.

.sp
This makes cmake configuration consistent in terms of WinRT among
platforms \- if you did not enable the WinRT compilation explicitly, it
will be disabled (by either not enabling it or explicitly disabling it)
.sp
Note: WinRT compilation is always explicitly disabled for C language

This offers low\-level control over the generated Xcode project file.
It is meant as a last resort for specifying settings that CMake does
not otherwise have a way to control.  Although this can override a
setting CMake normally produces on its own, doing so bypasses CMake\(aqs

to use when compiling host code for \fBCUDA\fP or \fBHIP\fP language files.
This maps to the \fBnvcc \-ccbin\fP option.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_HOST_COMPILER\fP variable may be set explicitly before CUDA
or HIP is first enabled by a \fI\%project()\fP or \fI\%enable_language()\fP
command.
This can be done via \fB\-DCMAKE_<LANG>_HOST_COMPILER=...\fP on the command line
or in a \fI\%toolchain file\fP\&.  Or, one may set
the \fI\%CUDAHOSTCXX\fP or \fI\%HIPHOSTCXX\fP environment variable to
provide a default value.
.sp
Once the CUDA or HIP language is enabled, the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_HOST_COMPILER\fP
variable is read\-only and changes to it are undefined behavior.

File extensions that should be ignored by the build.
.sp
This is a list of file extensions that may be part of a project for a
given language but are not compiled.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.
.sp
CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on compiler
command lines for language \fB<LANG>\fP\&.  This prevents system include
directories from being treated as user include directories on some
compilers, which is important for \fBC\fP, \fBCXX\fP, and \fBCUDA\fP to
avoid overriding standard library headers.
.sp
This value is not used for \fBFortran\fP because it has no standard
library headers and some compilers do not search their implicit
include directories for module \fB\&.mod\fP files.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES
.sp
Implicit linker search path detected for language \fB<LANG>\fP\&.
.sp
Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime
libraries and default library search paths when they invoke a linker.
These paths are implicit linker search directories for the compiler\(aqs
language.
.sp
For each language enabled by the \fI\%project()\fP or
\fI\%enable_language()\fP command, CMake automatically detects these
directories and reports the results in this variable.
The \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES_EXCLUDE\fP environment
variable may be set to exclude specific directories from the automatically
detected results.
.sp
When linking to a static library, CMake adds the implicit link directories
from this variable for each language used in the static library (except
the language whose compiler is used to drive linking).  In the case of an
imported static library, the \fI\%IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES\fP
target property lists the languages whose implicit link information is
needed.  If any of the languages is not enabled, its value for the
\fBCMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES\fP variable may instead be provided
by the project.  Or, a \fI\%toolchain file\fP
may set the variable to a value known for the specified toolchain.  It will
either be overridden when the language is enabled, or used as a fallback.
.sp
Some toolchains read implicit directories from an environment variable such as
\fBLIBRARY_PATH\fP\&.  If using such an environment variable, keep its value
consistent when operating in a given build tree because CMake saves the value
detected when first creating a build tree.
.sp
If policy \fI\%CMP0060\fP is not set to \fBNEW\fP, then when a library in one
of these directories is given by full path to \fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP
CMake will generate the \fB\-l<name>\fP form on link lines for historical
purposes.
.sp
See also the \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP variable.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_FRAMEWORK_DIRECTORIES
.sp
Implicit linker framework search path detected for language \fB<LANG>\fP\&.
.sp
These paths are implicit linker framework search directories for the
compiler\(aqs language.  CMake automatically detects these directories
for each language and reports the results in this variable.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES
.sp
Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language \fB<LANG>\fP\&.
.sp
Compilers typically pass language runtime library names and other
flags when they invoke a linker.  These flags are implicit link
options for the compiler\(aqs language.  For each language enabled
by the \fI\%project()\fP or \fI\%enable_language()\fP command,
CMake automatically detects these libraries and flags and reports
the results in this variable.
.sp
When linking to a static library, CMake adds the implicit link libraries and
flags from this variable for each language used in the static library (except
the language whose compiler is used to drive linking).  In the case of an
imported static library, the \fI\%IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES\fP
target property lists the languages whose implicit link information is
needed.  If any of the languages is not enabled, its value for the
\fBCMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP variable may instead be provided
by the project.  Or, a \fI\%toolchain file\fP
may set the variable to a value known for the specified toolchain.  It will
either be overridden when the language is enabled, or used as a fallback.
.sp
See also the \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES\fP variable.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
.sp
Target architecture library directory name detected for \fB<LANG>\fP\&.
.sp
If the \fB<LANG>\fP compiler passes to the linker an architecture\-specific
system library search directory such as \fB<prefix>/lib/<arch>\fP this
variable contains the \fB<arch>\fP name if/as detected by CMake.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_EXECUTABLE
.sp
Rule variable to link an executable.
.sp
Rule variable to link an executable for the given language.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG
.sp
New in version 3.13.

.sp
Defines the syntax of compiler driver option to pass options to the linker
tool. It will be used to translate the \fBLINKER:\fP prefix in the link options
(see \fI\%add_link_options()\fP and \fI\%target_link_options()\fP).
.sp
This variable holds a \fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP of tokens.
If a space (i.e. \(dq \(dq) is specified as last token, flag and \fBLINKER:\fP
arguments will be specified as separate arguments to the compiler driver.
The \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP\fP variable can be specified
to manage concatenation of arguments.

.SS Checking for Language Standard Support
.sp
It is possible to use the value of the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_LATEST\fP
variable to check for language standard support. This can be used to, e.g.,
conditionally enable optional features for a distributed library.
.sp
When doing so, one should be careful to \fBnot\fP rely on integer value
comparisons between standard levels. This is because some older standards of
a given language which are supported by CMake (e.g., C++98, represented as
\fB98\fP) will have a higher numerical value than newer standards of that same
language.

.SH VARIABLES FOR CPACK
.SS CPACK_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
.sp
List of files which have been installed using an \fBABSOLUTE DESTINATION\fP path.
.sp
This variable is a Read\-Only variable which is set internally by CPack
during installation and before packaging using
\fI\%CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES\fP defined in \fBcmake_install.cmake\fP
scripts.  The value can be used within CPack project configuration
file and/or \fBCPack<GEN>.cmake\fP file of \fB<GEN>\fP generator.
.SS CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
.sp
Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory (component case).
.sp
Similar usage as \fI\%CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY\fP but for the
component case.  See \fI\%CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY\fP
documentation for the detail.
.SS CPACK_CUSTOM_INSTALL_VARIABLES
.sp
New in version 3.21.

.sp
CPack variables (set via e.g. \fI\%cpack \-D\fP, \fBCPackConfig.cmake\fP or
\fI\%CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE\fP scripts) are not directly visible in
installation scripts.  Instead, one can pass a list of \fBvarName=value\fP
pairs in the \fBCPACK_CUSTOM_INSTALL_VARIABLES\fP variable.  At install time,
each list item will result in a variable of the specified name (\fBvarName\fP)
being set to the given \fBvalue\fP\&.  The \fB=\fP can be omitted for an empty
\fBvalue\fP\&.
.sp
\fBCPACK_CUSTOM_INSTALL_VARIABLES\fP allows the packaging installation to be
influenced by the user or driving script at CPack runtime without having to
regenerate the install scripts.
.SS Example
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
install(FILES large.txt DESTINATION data)

install(CODE [[
  if(ENABLE_COMPRESSION)
    # \(dqrun\-compressor\(dq is a fictional tool that produces
    # large.txt.xz from large.txt and then removes the input file
    execute_process(COMMAND run\-compressor $ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/large.txt)
  endif()
]])
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With the above example snippet, \fI\%cpack\fP will by default
run the installation script with \fBENABLE_COMPRESSION\fP unset, resulting in
a package containing the uncompressed \fBlarge.txt\fP\&.  This can be overridden
when invoking \fI\%cpack\fP like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cpack \-D \(dqCPACK_CUSTOM_INSTALL_VARIABLES=ENABLE_COMPRESSION=TRUE\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The installation script will then run with \fBENABLE_COMPRESSION\fP set to
\fBTRUE\fP, resulting in a package containing the compressed \fBlarge.txt.xz\fP
instead.
.SS CPACK_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
.sp
Ask CPack to error out as soon as a file with absolute \fBINSTALL DESTINATION\fP
is encountered.
.sp
The fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offending
file takes place.  Some CPack generators, like \fBNSIS\fP, enforce this
internally.  This variable triggers the definition
of \fI\%CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION\fP when CPack
runs.
.SS CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
.sp
Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory.
.sp
When preparing a package CPack installs the item under the so\-called
top level directory.  The purpose of is to include (set to \fB1\fP or \fBON\fP or
\fBTRUE\fP) the top level directory in the package or not (set to \fB0\fP or
\fBOFF\fP or \fBFALSE\fP).
.sp
Each CPack generator has a built\-in default value for this variable.
E.g.  Archive generators (ZIP, TGZ, ...) includes the top level
whereas RPM or DEB don\(aqt.  The user may override the default value by
setting this variable.
.sp
There is a similar variable
\fI\%CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY\fP which may be used
to override the behavior for the component packaging
case which may have different default value for historical (now
backward compatibility) reason.
.SS CPACK_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
.sp
New in version 3.11.

.sp
Default permissions for implicitly created directories during packaging.
.sp
This variable serves the same purpose during packaging as the
\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS\fP variable
serves during installation (e.g. \fBmake install\fP).
.sp
If \fIinclude(CPack)\fP is used then by default this variable is set to the content
of \fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS\fP\&.
.SS CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX
.sp
The prefix used in the built package.
.sp
Each CPack generator has a default value (like \fB/usr\fP).  This default
value may be overwritten from the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP or the \fI\%cpack(1)\fP
command line by setting an alternative value.  Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX \(dq/opt\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is not the same purpose as \fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP which is used
when installing from the build tree without building a package.
.SS CPACK_SET_DESTDIR
.sp
Boolean toggle to make CPack use \fBDESTDIR\fP mechanism when packaging.
.sp
\fBDESTDIR\fP means DESTination DIRectory.  It is commonly used by makefile
users in order to install software at non\-default location.  It is a
basic relocation mechanism that should not be used on Windows (see
\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP documentation).  It is usually invoked like
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
make DESTDIR=/home/john install
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
which will install the concerned software using the installation
prefix, e.g. \fB/usr/local\fP prepended with the \fBDESTDIR\fP value which
finally gives \fB/home/john/usr/local\fP\&.  When preparing a package, CPack
first installs the items to be packaged in a local (to the build tree)
directory by using the same \fBDESTDIR\fP mechanism.  Nevertheless, if
\fBCPACK_SET_DESTDIR\fP is set then CPack will set \fBDESTDIR\fP before doing the
local install.  The most noticeable difference is that without
\fBCPACK_SET_DESTDIR\fP, CPack uses \fI\%CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP
as a prefix whereas with \fBCPACK_SET_DESTDIR\fP set, CPack will use
\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP as a prefix.
.sp
Manually setting \fBCPACK_SET_DESTDIR\fP may help (or simply be necessary)
if some install rules uses absolute \fBDESTINATION\fP (see CMake
\fI\%install()\fP command).  However, starting with CPack/CMake 2.8.3 RPM
and DEB installers tries to handle \fBDESTDIR\fP automatically so that it is
seldom necessary for the user to set it.
.SS CPACK_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
.sp
Ask CPack to warn each time a file with absolute \fBINSTALL DESTINATION\fP is
encountered.
.sp
This variable triggers the definition of
\fI\%CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION\fP when CPack runs
\fBcmake_install.cmake\fP scripts.
.SH VARIABLE EXPANSION OPERATORS
.SS CACHE
.sp
New in version 3.13.

.sp
Operator to read cache variables.
.sp
Use the syntax \fB$CACHE{VAR}\fP to read cache entry \fBVAR\fP\&.
See the \fI\%cmake\-language(7) variables\fP
documentation for more complete documentation of the interaction of
normal variables and cache entries.
.sp
When evaluating \fI\%Variable References\fP of the form \fB${VAR}\fP,
CMake first searches for a normal variable with that name, and if not
found CMake will search for a cache entry with that name.
The \fB$CACHE{VAR}\fP syntax can be used to do direct cache lookup and
ignore any existing normal variable.
.sp
See the \fI\%set()\fP and \fI\%unset()\fP commands to see how to
write or remove cache variables.
.SS ENV
.sp
Operator to read environment variables.
.sp
Use the syntax \fB$ENV{VAR}\fP to read environment variable \fBVAR\fP\&.
.sp
To test whether an environment variable is defined, use the signature
\fBif(DEFINED ENV{<name>})\fP of the \fI\%if()\fP command.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Environment variable names containing special characters like parentheses
may need to be escaped.  (Policy \fI\%CMP0053\fP must also be enabled.)
For example, to get the value of the Windows environment variable
\fBProgramFiles(x86)\fP, use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(ProgramFiles_x86 \(dq$ENV{ProgramFiles\e(x86\e)}\(dq)
.ft P

For general information on environment variables, see the
\fI\%Environment Variables\fP
section in the \fI\%cmake\-language(7)\fP manual.
.SH INTERNAL VARIABLES
.sp
CMake has many internal variables.  Most of them are undocumented.
Some of them, however, were at some point described as normal
variables, and therefore may be encountered in legacy code. They
are subject to change, and not recommended for use in project code.
.SS CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY
.sp
Path to top of source tree. Same as \fI\%CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\fP\&.
.sp
This is an internal cache entry used to locate the source directory
when loading a \fBCMakeCache.txt\fP from a build tree.  It should not
be used in project code.  The variable \fI\%CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\fP
has the same value and should be preferred.
.SS CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI
.sp
An internal variable subject to change.
.sp
This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ABI
.sp
An internal variable subject to change.
.sp
This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ARCHITECTURE_ID
.sp
New in version 3.10.

.sp
An internal variable subject to change.
.sp
This is used to identify the variant of a compiler based on its target
architecture.  For some compilers this is needed to determine the correct
usage.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION_INTERNAL
.sp
New in version 3.10.

.sp
An internal variable subject to change.
.sp
This is used to identify the variant of a compiler based on an internal
version number.  For some compilers this is needed to determine the
correct usage.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE
.sp
An internal variable subject to change.
.sp
Preference value for linker language selection.
.sp
The \(dqlinker language\(dq for executable, shared library, and module
targets is the language whose compiler will invoke the linker.  The
\fI\%LINKER_LANGUAGE\fP target property sets the language explicitly.
Otherwise, the linker language is that whose linker preference value
is highest among languages compiled and linked into the target.  See
also the \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES\fP variable.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES
.sp
An internal variable subject to change.
.sp
True if \fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE\fP propagates across targets.
.sp
This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a target.
Languages compiled directly into the target are always considered.  A
language compiled into static libraries linked by the target is
considered if this variable is true.
.SS CMAKE_<LANG>_PLATFORM_ID
.sp
An internal variable subject to change.
.sp
This is used in determining the platform and is subject to change.
.SS CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS
.sp
Skip \fB_BUILD_TYPE\fP flags if true.
.sp
This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake to tell CMake
to skip the \fB_BUILD_TYPE\fP flags.
.SS CMAKE_VS_INTEL_Fortran_PROJECT_VERSION
.sp
When generating for \fI\%Visual Studio 12 2013\fP or greater with the Intel
Fortran plugin installed, this specifies the \fB\&.vfproj\fP project file format
version.  This is intended for internal use by CMake and should not be
used by project code.
.SH DEPRECATED VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION
.SS CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
.sp
Deprecated since version 3.27: Support for \fI\%Extra Generators\fP is deprecated and will be removed from
a future version of CMake.  IDEs may use the \fI\%cmake\-file\-api(7)\fP
to view CMake\-generated project build trees.

.sp
The extra generator used to build the project.  See
\fI\%cmake\-generators(7)\fP\&.
.sp
When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks, CodeLite, Kate or Sublime generators, CMake
generates Makefiles (\fI\%CMAKE_GENERATOR\fP) and additionally project
files for the respective IDE.  This IDE project file generator is stored in
\fBCMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR\fP (e.g.  \fBEclipse CDT4\fP).
.SH DEPRECATED VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR
.SS CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE
.sp
Deprecated since version 3.15.

.sp
Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.
.sp
By default, \fI\%AUTOMOC\fP behaves exactly as described in the
documentation of the \fI\%AUTOMOC\fP target property.  When set to
\fBTRUE\fP, it accepts more input and tries to find the correct input file for
\fBmoc\fP even if it differs from the documented behavior.  In this mode it
e.g.  also checks whether a header file is intended to be processed by moc
when a \fB\(dqfoo.moc\(dq\fP file has been included.
.sp
Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.
.SS CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
.sp
Deprecated.  See CMake Policy \fI\%CMP0001\fP documentation.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
Deprecated since version 3.16: Use the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP variable instead.

.sp
By default this variable is not set. If neither
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP nor
\fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP is set, then
\fI\%find_package()\fP will use the \fI\%User Package Registry\fP
unless the \fBNO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP option is provided.
.sp
\fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP is ignored if
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP is set.
.sp
In some cases, for example to locate only system wide installations, it
is not desirable to use the \fI\%User Package Registry\fP when searching
for packages. If the \fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP
variable is \fBTRUE\fP, all the \fI\%find_package()\fP commands will skip
the \fI\%User Package Registry\fP as if they were called with the
\fBNO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP argument.
.sp
See also \fI\%Disabling the Package Registry\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
.sp
New in version 3.1.

.sp
Deprecated since version 3.16: Use the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP variable instead.

.sp
By default this variable is not set. If neither
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP nor
\fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP is set, then
\fI\%find_package()\fP will use the \fI\%System Package Registry\fP
unless the \fBNO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP option is provided.
.sp
\fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP is ignored if
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP is set.
.sp
In some cases, it is not desirable to use the
\fI\%System Package Registry\fP when searching for packages. If the
\fBCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP variable is
\fBTRUE\fP, all the \fI\%find_package()\fP commands will skip
the \fI\%System Package Registry\fP as if they were called with the
\fBNO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP argument.
.sp
See also \fI\%Disabling the Package Registry\fP\&.
