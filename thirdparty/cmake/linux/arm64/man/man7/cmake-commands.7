.B cmake_language(SET_DEPENDENCY_PROVIDER <command> SUPPORTED_METHODS <methods>...)
When a call is made to \fI\%find_package()\fP or
\fI\%FetchContent_MakeAvailable()\fP, the call may be forwarded to a
dependency provider which then has the opportunity to fulfill the request.
If the request is for one of the \fB<methods>\fP specified when the provider
was set, CMake calls the provider\(aqs \fB<command>\fP with a set of
method\-specific arguments.  If the provider does not fulfill the request,
or if the provider doesn\(aqt support the request\(aqs method, or no provider
is set, the built\-in \fI\%find_package()\fP or
\fI\%FetchContent_MakeAvailable()\fP implementation is used to fulfill
the request in the usual way.
.sp
One or more of the following values can be specified for the \fB<methods>\fP
when setting the provider:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBFIND_PACKAGE\fP
The provider command accepts \fI\%find_package()\fP requests.
.TP
.B \fBFETCHCONTENT_MAKEAVAILABLE_SERIAL\fP
The provider command accepts \fI\%FetchContent_MakeAvailable()\fP
requests.  It expects each dependency to be fed to the provider command
one at a time, not the whole list in one go.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Only one provider can be set at any point in time.  If a provider is already
set when \fBcmake_language(SET_DEPENDENCY_PROVIDER)\fP is called, the new
provider replaces the previously set one.  The specified \fB<command>\fP must
already exist when \fBcmake_language(SET_DEPENDENCY_PROVIDER)\fP is called.
As a special case, providing an empty string for the \fB<command>\fP and no
\fB<methods>\fP will discard any previously set provider.
.sp
The dependency provider can only be set while processing one of the files
specified by the \fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES\fP variable.
Thus, dependency providers can only be set as part of the first call to
\fI\%project()\fP\&.  Calling \fBcmake_language(SET_DEPENDENCY_PROVIDER)\fP
outside of that context will result in an error.
.sp
New in version 3.30: The \fI\%PROPAGATE_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES_TO_TRY_COMPILE\fP global
property can be set if the dependency provider also wants to be enabled
in whole\-project calls to \fI\%try_compile()\fP\&.

The choice of dependency provider should always be under the user\(aqs control.
As a convenience, a project may choose to provide a file that users can

.SS Provider commands
.sp
Providers define a single \fB<command>\fP to accept requests.  The name of
the command should be specific to that provider, not something overly
generic that another provider might also use.  This enables users to compose
different providers in their own custom provider.  The recommended form is
\fBxxx_provide_dependency()\fP, where \fBxxx\fP is the provider\-specific part
(e.g. \fBvcpkg_provide_dependency()\fP, \fBconan_provide_dependency()\fP,
\fBourcompany_provide_dependency()\fP, and so on).

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Because some methods expect certain variables to be set in the calling scope,
the provider command should typically be implemented as a macro rather than a
function.  This ensures it does not introduce a new variable scope.
.sp
The arguments CMake passes to the dependency provider depend on the type of
request.  The first argument is always the method, and it will only ever
be one of the \fB<methods>\fP that was specified when setting the provider.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBFIND_PACKAGE\fP
The \fB<method\-specific\-args>\fP will be everything passed to the
\fI\%find_package()\fP call that requested the dependency.  The first of
these \fB<method\-specific\-args>\fP will therefore always be the name of the
dependency.  Dependency names are case\-sensitive for this method because
\fI\%find_package()\fP treats them case\-sensitively too.
.sp
If the provider command fulfills the request, it must set the same variable
that \fI\%find_package()\fP expects to be set.  For a dependency named
\fBdepName\fP, the provider must set \fBdepName_FOUND\fP to true if it fulfilled
the request.  If the provider returns without setting this variable, CMake
will assume the request was not fulfilled and will fall back to the
built\-in implementation.
.sp
If the provider needs to call the built\-in \fI\%find_package()\fP
implementation as part of its processing, it can do so by including the
\fBBYPASS_PROVIDER\fP keyword as one of the arguments.
.TP
.B \fBFETCHCONTENT_MAKEAVAILABLE_SERIAL\fP
The \fB<method\-specific\-args>\fP will be everything passed to the
\fI\%FetchContent_Declare()\fP call that corresponds to the requested
dependency, with the following exceptions:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBSOURCE_DIR\fP or \fBBINARY_DIR\fP were not part of the original
declared arguments, they will be added with their default values.
.IP \(bu 2
If \fI\%FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE\fP is set to \fBNEVER\fP,
any \fBFIND_PACKAGE_ARGS\fP will be omitted.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBOVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE\fP keyword is always omitted.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first of the \fB<method\-specific\-args>\fP will always be the name of the
dependency.  Dependency names are case\-insensitive for this method because
\fI\%FetchContent\fP also treats them case\-insensitively.
.sp
If the provider fulfills the request, it should call
\fI\%FetchContent_SetPopulated()\fP, passing the name of the dependency as
the first argument.  The \fBSOURCE_DIR\fP and \fBBINARY_DIR\fP arguments to that
command should only be given if the provider makes the dependency\(aqs source
and build directories available in exactly the same way as the built\-in
\fI\%FetchContent_MakeAvailable()\fP command.
.sp
If the provider returns without calling \fI\%FetchContent_SetPopulated()\fP
for the named dependency, CMake will assume the request was not fulfilled
and will fall back to the built\-in implementation.
.sp
Note that empty arguments may be significant for this method (e.g. an empty
string following a \fBGIT_SUBMODULES\fP keyword).  Therefore, if forwarding
these arguments on to another command, extra care must be taken to avoid such
arguments being silently dropped.
.sp
If \fBFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_<uppercaseDepName>\fP is set, then the
dependency provider will never see requests for the \fB<depName>\fP dependency
for this method. When the user sets such a variable, they are explicitly
overriding where to get that dependency from and are taking on the
responsibility that their overriding version meets any requirements for that
dependency and is compatible with whatever else in the project uses it.
Depending on the value of \fI\%FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE\fP
and whether the \fBOVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE\fP option was given to
\fI\%FetchContent_Declare()\fP, having
\fBFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_<uppercaseDepName>\fP set may also prevent the
dependency provider from seeing requests for a \fBfind_package(depName)\fP
call too.
.UNINDENT
.SS Provider Examples
.sp
This first example only intercepts \fI\%find_package()\fP calls.  The
provider command runs an external tool which copies the relevant artifacts
into a provider\-specific directory, if that tool knows about the dependency.
It then relies on the built\-in implementation to then find those artifacts.
\fI\%FetchContent_MakeAvailable()\fP calls would not go through the provider.

The next example demonstrates a provider that accepts both methods, but
only handles one specific dependency.  It enforces providing Google Test
using \fI\%FetchContent\fP, but leaves all other dependencies to be
fulfilled by CMake\(aqs built\-in implementation.  It accepts a few different
names, which demonstrates one way of working around projects that hard\-code
an unusual or undesirable way of adding this particular dependency to the
build.  The example also demonstrates how to use the \fI\%list()\fP command
to preserve variables that may be overwritten by a call to

New in version 3.5: This command is implemented natively.  Previously, it has been defined in the
module \fI\%CMakeParseArguments\fP\&.

.sp
This command is for use in macros or functions.
It processes the arguments given to that macro or function,
and defines a set of variables which hold the values of the
respective options.
.sp
The first signature reads processes arguments passed in the \fB<args>...\fP\&.
This may be used in either a \fI\%macro()\fP or a \fI\%function()\fP\&.
.sp
New in version 3.7: The \fBPARSE_ARGV\fP signature is only for use in a \fI\%function()\fP
body.  In this case the arguments that are parsed come from the
\fBARGV#\fP variables of the calling function.  The parsing starts with
the \fB<N>\fP\-th argument, where \fB<N>\fP is an unsigned integer.
This allows for the values to have special characters like \fB;\fP in them.

.sp
The \fB<options>\fP argument contains all options for the respective macro,
i.e.  keywords which can be used when calling the macro without any value
following, like e.g.  the \fBOPTIONAL\fP keyword of the \fI\%install()\fP
command.
.sp
The \fB<one_value_keywords>\fP argument contains all keywords for this macro
which are followed by one value, like e.g. \fBDESTINATION\fP keyword of the
\fI\%install()\fP command.
.sp
The \fB<multi_value_keywords>\fP argument contains all keywords for this
macro which can be followed by more than one value, like e.g. the
\fBTARGETS\fP or \fBFILES\fP keywords of the \fI\%install()\fP command.
.sp
Changed in version 3.5: All keywords shall be unique. I.e. every keyword shall only be specified
once in either \fB<options>\fP, \fB<one_value_keywords>\fP or
\fB<multi_value_keywords>\fP\&. A warning will be emitted if uniqueness is
violated.

.sp
When done, \fBcmake_parse_arguments\fP will consider for each of the
keywords listed in \fB<options>\fP, \fB<one_value_keywords>\fP and
\fB<multi_value_keywords>\fP a variable composed of the given \fB<prefix>\fP
followed by \fB\(dq_\(dq\fP and the name of the respective keyword.  These
variables will then hold the respective value from the argument list
or be undefined if the associated option could not be found.
For the \fB<options>\fP keywords, these will always be defined,
to \fBTRUE\fP or \fBFALSE\fP, whether the option is in the argument list or not.
.sp
All remaining arguments are collected in a variable
\fB<prefix>_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS\fP that will be undefined if all arguments
were recognized. This can be checked afterwards to see
whether your macro was called with unrecognized parameters.
.sp
New in version 3.15: \fB<one_value_keywords>\fP and \fB<multi_value_keywords>\fP that were given no
values at all are collected in a variable
\fB<prefix>_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES\fP that will be undefined if all keywords
received values. This can be checked to see if there were keywords without
any values given.

.sp
Consider the following example macro, \fBmy_install()\fP, which takes similar
arguments to the real \fI\%install()\fP command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
macro(my_install)
    set(options OPTIONAL FAST)
    set(oneValueArgs DESTINATION RENAME)
    set(multiValueArgs TARGETS CONFIGURATIONS)
    cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL \(dq${options}\(dq \(dq${oneValueArgs}\(dq
                          \(dq${multiValueArgs}\(dq ${ARGN} )

    # ...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Assume \fBmy_install()\fP has been called like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
my_install(TARGETS foo bar DESTINATION bin OPTIONAL blub CONFIGURATIONS)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After the \fBcmake_parse_arguments\fP call the macro will have set or undefined
the following variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL = TRUE
MY_INSTALL_FAST = FALSE # was not used in call to my_install
MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION = \(dqbin\(dq
MY_INSTALL_RENAME <UNDEFINED> # was not used
MY_INSTALL_TARGETS = \(dqfoo;bar\(dq
MY_INSTALL_CONFIGURATIONS <UNDEFINED> # was not used
MY_INSTALL_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS = \(dqblub\(dq # nothing expected after \(dqOPTIONAL\(dq
MY_INSTALL_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES = \(dqCONFIGURATIONS\(dq
         # No value for \(dqCONFIGURATIONS\(dq given
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can then continue and process these variables.
.sp
Keywords terminate lists of values, e.g. if directly after a
\fBone_value_keyword\fP another recognized keyword follows, this is
interpreted as the beginning of the new option.  E.g.
\fBmy_install(TARGETS foo DESTINATION OPTIONAL)\fP would result in
\fBMY_INSTALL_DESTINATION\fP set to \fB\(dqOPTIONAL\(dq\fP, but as \fBOPTIONAL\fP
is a keyword itself \fBMY_INSTALL_DESTINATION\fP will be empty (but added
to \fBMY_INSTALL_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES\fP) and \fBMY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL\fP will
therefore be set to \fBTRUE\fP\&.

This command is for the manipulation of paths.  Only syntactic aspects of
paths are handled, there is no interaction of any kind with any underlying
file system.  The path may represent a non\-existing path or even one that
is not allowed to exist on the current file system or platform.
For operations that do interact with the filesystem, see the \fI\%file()\fP
command.

.INDENT 3.5
The \fBcmake_path\fP command handles paths in the format of the build system
(i.e. the host platform), not the target system.  When cross\-compiling,
if the path contains elements that are not representable on the host
platform (e.g. a drive letter when the host is not Windows), the results
will be unpredictable.

.SS Conventions
.sp
The following conventions are used in this command\(aqs documentation:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB<path\-var>\fP
Always the name of a variable.  For commands that expect a \fB<path\-var>\fP
as input, the variable must exist and it is expected to hold a single path.
.TP
.B \fB<input>\fP
A string literal which may contain a path, path fragment, or multiple paths
with a special separator depending on the command.  See the description of
each command to see how this is interpreted.
.TP
.B \fB<input>...\fP
Zero or more string literal arguments.
.TP
.B \fB<out\-var>\fP
The name of a variable into which the result of a command will be written.
.UNINDENT
.SS Path Structure And Terminology
.sp
A path has the following structure (all components are optional, with some
constraints):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
root\-name root\-directory\-separator (item\-name directory\-separator)* filename
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBroot\-name\fP
Identifies the root on a filesystem with multiple roots (such as \fB\(dqC:\(dq\fP
or \fB\(dq//myserver\(dq\fP). It is optional.
.TP
.B \fBroot\-directory\-separator\fP
A directory separator that, if present, indicates that this path is
absolute.  If it is missing and the first element other than the
\fBroot\-name\fP is an \fBitem\-name\fP, then the path is relative.
.TP
.B \fBitem\-name\fP
A sequence of characters that aren\(aqt directory separators.  This name may
identify a file, a hard link, a symbolic link, or a directory.  Two special
cases are recognized:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The item name consisting of a single dot character \fB\&.\fP is a
directory name that refers to the current directory.
.IP \(bu 2
The item name consisting of two dot characters \fB\&..\fP is a
directory name that refers to the parent directory.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB(...)*\fP pattern shown above is to indicate that there can be zero
or more item names, with multiple items separated by a
\fBdirectory\-separator\fP\&.  The \fB()*\fP characters are not part of the path.
.TP
.B \fBdirectory\-separator\fP
The only recognized directory separator is a forward slash character \fB/\fP\&.
If this character is repeated, it is treated as a single directory
separator.  In other words, \fB/usr///////lib\fP is the same as \fB/usr/lib\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBfilename\fP
A path has a \fBfilename\fP if it does not end with a \fBdirectory\-separator\fP\&.
The \fBfilename\fP is effectively the last \fBitem\-name\fP of the path, so it
can also be a hard link, symbolic link or a directory.
.sp
A \fBfilename\fP can have an \fIextension\fP\&.  By default, the extension is
defined as the sub\-string beginning at the left\-most period (including
the period) and until the end of the \fBfilename\fP\&.  In commands that
accept a \fBLAST_ONLY\fP keyword, \fBLAST_ONLY\fP changes the interpretation
to the sub\-string beginning at the right\-most period.
.sp
The following exceptions apply to the above interpretation:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If the first character in the \fBfilename\fP is a period, that period is
ignored (i.e. a \fBfilename\fP like \fB\(dq.profile\(dq\fP is treated as having
no extension).
.IP \(bu 2
If the \fBfilename\fP is either \fB\&.\fP or \fB\&..\fP, it has no extension.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fIstem\fP is the part of the \fBfilename\fP before the extension.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Some commands refer to a \fBroot\-path\fP\&.  This is the concatenation of
\fBroot\-name\fP and \fBroot\-directory\-separator\fP, either or both of which can
be empty.  A \fBrelative\-part\fP refers to the full path with any \fBroot\-path\fP
removed.
.SS Creating A Path Variable
.sp
While a path can be created with care using an ordinary \fI\%set()\fP
command, it is recommended to use \fI\%cmake_path(SET)\fP
instead, as it automatically converts the path to the required form where
required.  The \fI\%cmake_path(APPEND)\fP subcommand may
be another suitable alternative where a path needs to be constructed by
joining fragments.  The following example compares the three methods for
constructing the same path:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(path1 \(dq${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/data\(dq)

cmake_path(SET path2 \(dq${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/data\(dq)

cmake_path(APPEND path3 \(dq${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}\(dq \(dqdata\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fI\%Modification\fP and \fI\%Generation\fP sub\-commands can either store the result
in\-place, or in a separate variable named after an \fBOUTPUT_VARIABLE\fP
keyword.  All other sub\-commands store the result in a mandatory \fB<out\-var>\fP
variable.
.SS Normalization
.sp
Some sub\-commands support \fInormalizing\fP a path.  The algorithm used to
normalize a path is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
If the path is empty, stop (the normalized form of an empty path is
also an empty path).
.IP 2. 3
Replace each \fBdirectory\-separator\fP, which may consist of multiple
separators, with a single \fB/\fP (\fB/a///b  \-\-> /a/b\fP).
.IP 3. 3
Remove each solitary period (\fB\&.\fP) and any immediately following
\fBdirectory\-separator\fP (\fB/a/./b/. \-\-> /a/b\fP).
.IP 4. 3
Remove each \fBitem\-name\fP (other than \fB\&..\fP) that is immediately
followed by a \fBdirectory\-separator\fP and a \fB\&..\fP, along with any
immediately following \fBdirectory\-separator\fP (\fB/a/b/../c \-\-> a/c\fP).
.IP 5. 3
If there is a \fBroot\-directory\fP, remove any \fB\&..\fP and any
\fBdirectory\-separators\fP immediately following them.  The parent of the
root directory is treated as still the root directory (\fB/../a \-\-> /a\fP).
.IP 6. 3
If the last \fBitem\-name\fP is \fB\&..\fP, remove any trailing
\fBdirectory\-separator\fP (\fB\&../ \-\-> ..\fP).
.IP 7. 3
If the path is empty by this stage, add a \fBdot\fP (normal form of \fB\&./\fP
is \fB\&.\fP).
.UNINDENT
.SS Decomposition
.sp
The following forms of the \fBGET\fP subcommand each retrieve a different
component or group of components from a path.  See
\fI\%Path Structure And Terminology\fP for the meaning of each path component.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If a requested component is not present in the path, an empty string will be
stored in \fB<out\-var>\fP\&.  For example, only Windows systems have the concept
of a \fBroot\-name\fP, so when the host machine is non\-Windows, the \fBROOT_NAME\fP
subcommand will always return an empty string.
.sp
For \fBPARENT_PATH\fP, if the \fI\%HAS_RELATIVE_PART\fP subcommand returns false,
the result is a copy of \fB<path\-var>\fP\&.  Note that this implies that a root
directory is considered to have a parent, with that parent being itself.
Where \fI\%HAS_RELATIVE_PART\fP returns true, the result will essentially be
\fB<path\-var>\fP with one less element.

.SS cmake_policy
.sp
Manage CMake Policy settings.  See the \fI\%cmake\-policies(7)\fP
manual for defined policies.
.sp
As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior
in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.
The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each
new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form
\fBCMP<NNNN>\fP where \fB<NNNN>\fP is an integer index.  Documentation
associated with each policy describes the \fBOLD\fP and \fBNEW\fP behavior
and the reason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy
to select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior
to use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no
setting is available the \fBOLD\fP behavior is assumed and a warning is
produced requesting that the policy be set.
.SS Setting Policies by CMake Version
.sp
The \fBcmake_policy\fP command is used to set policies to \fBOLD\fP or \fBNEW\fP
behavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we
encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B cmake_policy(VERSION <min>[...<max>])
.UNINDENT
.sp
New in version 3.12: The optional \fB<max>\fP version.

.sp
\fB<min>\fP and the optional \fB<max>\fP are each CMake versions of the form
\fBmajor.minor[.patch[.tweak]]\fP, and the \fB\&...\fP is literal.  The \fB<min>\fP
version must be at least \fB2.4\fP and at most the running version of CMake.
The \fB<max>\fP version, if specified, must be at least the \fB<min>\fP version
but may exceed the running version of CMake.  If the running version of
CMake is older than 3.12, the extra \fB\&...\fP dots will be seen as version
component separators, resulting in the \fB\&...<max>\fP part being ignored and
preserving the pre\-3.12 behavior of basing policies on \fB<min>\fP\&.
.sp
This specifies that the current CMake code is written for the given
range of CMake versions.  All policies known to the running version of CMake
and introduced in the \fB<min>\fP (or \fB<max>\fP, if specified) version
or earlier will be set to use \fBNEW\fP behavior.  All policies
introduced in later versions will be unset (unless the
\fI\%CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>\fP variable sets a default).
This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake
version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.
.sp
Note that the \fI\%cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)\fP
command implicitly calls \fBcmake_policy(VERSION)\fP too.
.sp
Changed in version 3.27: Compatibility with versions of CMake older than 3.5 is deprecated.
Calls to \fI\%cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)\fP or
\fI\%cmake_policy(VERSION)\fP that do not specify at least
3.5 as their policy version (optionally via \fB\&...<max>\fP)
will produce a deprecation warning in CMake 3.27 and above.

.sp
Changed in version 3.19: Compatibility with versions of CMake older than 2.8.12 is deprecated.
Calls to \fI\%cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)\fP or
\fI\%cmake_policy(VERSION)\fP that do not specify at least
2.8.12 as their policy version (optionally via \fB\&...<max>\fP)
will produce a deprecation warning in CMake 3.19 and above.

policy state to \fBNEW\fP\&.

The output \fB<variable>\fP value will be \fBOLD\fP or \fBNEW\fP if the
policy is set, and empty otherwise.
.SS CMake Policy Stack
.sp
CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the
\fBcmake_policy\fP command affect only the top of the stack.  A new entry on
the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to
protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a new entry for
scripts loaded by \fI\%include()\fP and \fI\%find_package()\fP commands
except when invoked with the \fBNO_POLICY_SCOPE\fP option
(see also policy \fI\%CMP0011\fP).
The \fBcmake_policy\fP command provides an interface to manage custom
entries on the policy stack:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B cmake_policy(PUSH)
Create a new entry on the policy stack.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B cmake_policy(POP)
Remove the last policy stack entry created with \fBcmake_policy(PUSH)\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each \fBPUSH\fP must have a matching \fBPOP\fP to erase any changes.
This is useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.
Calls to the \fI\%cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)\fP,
\fI\%cmake_policy(VERSION)\fP, or \fI\%cmake_policy(SET)\fP commands
influence only the current top of the policy stack.
.sp
New in version 3.25: The \fI\%block(SCOPE_FOR POLICIES)\fP command offers a more flexible
and more secure way to manage the policy stack. The pop action is done
automatically when leaving the block scope, so there is no need to
precede each \fI\%return()\fP with a call to \fI\%cmake_policy(POP)\fP\&.

We do not recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from
your source tree.  If no CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is
added or removed then the generated build system cannot know when to
ask CMake to regenerate.
The \fBCONFIGURE_DEPENDS\fP flag may not work reliably on all generators, or
if a new generator is added in the future that cannot support it, projects
using it will be stuck. Even if \fBCONFIGURE_DEPENDS\fP works reliably, there
is still a cost to perform the check on every rebuild.

This sub\-command has some similarities to \fI\%configure_file()\fP

The \fBCOPY\fP signature copies files, directories, and symlinks to a
destination folder.  Relative input paths are evaluated with respect
to the current source directory, and a relative destination is
evaluated with respect to the current build directory.  Copying
preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists
at the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying preserves input
permissions unless explicit permissions or \fBNO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS\fP
are given (default is \fBUSE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS\fP).

New in version 3.15: If \fBFOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN\fP is specified, \fBCOPY\fP will recursively resolve
the symlinks at the paths given until a real file is found, and install
a corresponding symlink in the destination for each symlink encountered.
For each symlink that is installed, the resolution is stripped of the
directory, leaving only the filename, meaning that the new symlink points
to a file in the same directory as the symlink. This feature is useful on
some Unix systems, where libraries are installed as a chain of symlinks
with version numbers, with less specific versions pointing to more specific
versions. \fBFOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN\fP will install all of these symlinks and
the library itself into the destination directory. For example, if you have
the following directory structure:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB/opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so.1.2.3\fP

.sp
See the \fI\%install(DIRECTORY)\fP command for documentation of
permissions, \fBFILES_MATCHING\fP, \fBPATTERN\fP, \fBREGEX\fP, and
\fBEXCLUDE\fP options.  Copying directories preserves the structure
of their content even if options are used to select a subset of
files.
.sp
The \fBINSTALL\fP signature differs slightly from \fBCOPY\fP: it prints
status messages, and \fBNO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS\fP is default. Installation
scripts generated by the \fI\%install()\fP command use this signature
(with some undocumented options for internal use).

Create a link \fB<linkname>\fP that points to \fB<original>\fP\&.
It will be a hard link by default, but providing the \fBSYMBOLIC\fP option
results in a symbolic link instead.  Hard links require that \fBoriginal\fP
exists and is a file, not a directory.  If \fB<linkname>\fP already exists,
it will be overwritten.
.sp
The \fB<result>\fP variable, if specified, receives the status of the
operation.  It is set to \fB0\fP upon success or an error message otherwise.
If \fBRESULT\fP is not specified and the operation fails, a fatal error is
emitted.
.sp
Specifying \fBCOPY_ON_ERROR\fP enables copying the file as a fallback if
creating the link fails.  It can be useful for handling situations such as
\fB<original>\fP and \fB<linkname>\fP being on different drives or mount points,
which would make them unable to support a hard link.

.B file(ARCHIVE_CREATE\ OUTPUT\ <archive> PATHS\ <paths>... [FORMAT\ <format>] [COMPRESSION\ <compression> [COMPRESSION_LEVEL\ <compression\-level>]] [MTIME\ <mtime>] [VERBOSE])
New in version 3.18.

.sp
Creates the specified \fB<archive>\fP file with the files and directories
listed in \fB<paths>\fP\&.  Note that \fB<paths>\fP must list actual files or
directories; wildcards are not supported.
.sp
Use the \fBFORMAT\fP option to specify the archive format.  Supported values
for \fB<format>\fP are \fB7zip\fP, \fBgnutar\fP, \fBpax\fP, \fBpaxr\fP, \fBraw\fP and
\fBzip\fP\&.  If \fBFORMAT\fP is not given, the default format is \fBpaxr\fP\&.
.sp
Some archive formats allow the type of compression to be specified.
The \fB7zip\fP and \fBzip\fP archive formats already imply a specific type of
compression.  The other formats use no compression by default, but can be
directed to do so with the \fBCOMPRESSION\fP option.  Valid values for
\fB<compression>\fP are \fBNone\fP, \fBBZip2\fP, \fBGZip\fP, \fBXZ\fP, and \fBZstd\fP\&.
.sp
New in version 3.19: The compression level can be specified with the \fBCOMPRESSION_LEVEL\fP
option.  The \fB<compression\-level>\fP should be between 0\-9, with the
default being 0.  The \fBCOMPRESSION\fP option must be present when
\fBCOMPRESSION_LEVEL\fP is given.

.sp
Extracts or lists the content of the specified \fB<archive>\fP\&.
.sp
The directory where the content of the archive will be extracted to can
be specified using the \fBDESTINATION\fP option.  If the directory does not
exist, it will be created.  If \fBDESTINATION\fP is not given, the current
binary directory will be used.
.sp
If required, you may select which files and directories to list or extract
from the archive using the specified \fB<patterns>\fP\&.  Wildcards are
supported.  If the \fBPATTERNS\fP option is not given, the entire archive will

unresolved dependencies, an error is issued.
.TP
.B \fBCONFLICTING_DEPENDENCIES_PREFIX <conflicting_deps_prefix>\fP
Variable prefix in which to store conflicting dependency information.
Dependencies are conflicting if two files with the same name are found in
two different directories. The list of filenames that conflict are stored
in \fB<conflicting_deps_prefix>_FILENAMES\fP\&. For each filename, the list
of paths that were found for that filename are stored in
\fB<conflicting_deps_prefix>_<filename>\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBEXECUTABLES <executable_files>...\fP
List of executable files to read for dependencies. These are executables
that are typically created with \fI\%add_executable()\fP, but they do
not have to be created by CMake. On Apple platforms, the paths to these
files determine the value of \fB@executable_path\fP when recursively
resolving the libraries. Specifying any kind of library (\fBSTATIC\fP,
\fBMODULE\fP, or \fBSHARED\fP) here will result in undefined behavior.
.TP
.B \fBLIBRARIES <library_files>...\fP
List of library files to read for dependencies. These are libraries that
are typically created with \fI\%add_library(SHARED)\fP, but they do
not have to be created by CMake. Specifying \fBSTATIC\fP libraries,
\fBMODULE\fP libraries, or executables here will result in undefined
behavior.
.TP
.B \fBMODULES <module_files>...\fP
List of loadable module files to read for dependencies. These are modules
that are typically created with \fI\%add_library(MODULE)\fP, but they
do not have to be created by CMake. They are typically used by calling
\fBdlopen()\fP at runtime rather than linked at link time with \fBld \-l\fP\&.
Specifying \fBSTATIC\fP libraries, \fBSHARED\fP libraries, or executables
here will result in undefined behavior.
.TP
.B \fBDIRECTORIES <directories>...\fP
List of additional directories to search for dependencies. On Linux
platforms, these directories are searched if the dependency is not found
in any of the other usual paths. If it is found in such a directory, a
warning is issued, because it means that the file is incomplete (it does
not list all of the directories that contain its dependencies).
On Windows platforms, these directories are searched if the dependency
is not found in any of the other search paths, but no warning is issued,
because searching other paths is a normal part of Windows dependency
resolution. On Apple platforms, this argument has no effect.
.TP
.B \fBBUNDLE_EXECUTABLE <bundle_executable_file>\fP
Executable to treat as the \(dqbundle executable\(dq when resolving libraries.
On Apple platforms, this argument determines the value of
\fB@executable_path\fP when recursively resolving libraries for
\fBLIBRARIES\fP and \fBMODULES\fP files. It has no effect on \fBEXECUTABLES\fP
files. On other platforms, it has no effect. This is typically (but not

These arguments can be used to exclude unwanted system libraries when

.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
If the not\-yet\-resolved dependency matches any of the
\fBPRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES\fP, steps 2 and 3 are skipped, and the dependency
resolution proceeds to step 4.
.IP 2. 3
If the not\-yet\-resolved dependency matches any of the
\fBPRE_EXCLUDE_REGEXES\fP, dependency resolution stops for that dependency.
.IP 3. 3
Otherwise, dependency resolution proceeds.
.IP 4. 3
\fBfile(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)\fP searches for the dependency according
to the linking rules of the platform (see below).
.IP 5. 3
If the dependency is found, and its full path matches one of the
\fBPOST_INCLUDE_REGEXES\fP or \fBPOST_INCLUDE_FILES\fP, the full path is added
to the resolved dependencies, and \fBfile(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)\fP
recursively resolves that library\(aqs own dependencies. Otherwise, resolution
proceeds to step 6.
.IP 6. 3
If the dependency is found, but its full path matches one of the
\fBPOST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES\fP or \fBPOST_EXCLUDE_FILES\fP, it is not added to the
resolved dependencies, and dependency resolution stops for that dependency.
.IP 7. 3
If the dependency is found, and its full path does not match either
\fBPOST_INCLUDE_REGEXES\fP, \fBPOST_INCLUDE_FILES\fP, \fBPOST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES\fP,
or \fBPOST_EXCLUDE_FILES\fP, the full path is added to the resolved
dependencies, and \fBfile(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)\fP  recursively resolves
that library\(aqs own dependencies.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Different platforms have different rules for how dependencies are resolved.
These specifics are described here.
.sp
On Linux platforms, library resolution works as follows:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
If the depending file does not have any \fBRUNPATH\fP entries, and the
library exists in one of the depending file\(aqs \fBRPATH\fP entries, or its
parents\(aq, in that order, the dependency is resolved to that file.
.IP 2. 3
Otherwise, if the depending file has any \fBRUNPATH\fP entries, and the
library exists in one of those entries, the dependency is resolved to that
file.
.IP 3. 3
Otherwise, if the library exists in one of the directories listed by
\fBldconfig\fP, the dependency is resolved to that file.
.IP 4. 3
Otherwise, if the library exists in one of the \fBDIRECTORIES\fP entries,
the dependency is resolved to that file. In this case, a warning is
issued, because finding a file in one of the \fBDIRECTORIES\fP means that
the depending file is not complete (it does not list all the directories
from which it pulls dependencies).
.IP 5. 3
Otherwise, the dependency is unresolved.
.UNINDENT
.sp
On Windows platforms, library resolution works as follows:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
DLL dependency names are converted to lowercase for matching filters.
Windows DLL names are case\-insensitive, and some linkers mangle the
case of the DLL dependency names.  However, this makes it more difficult
for \fBPRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES\fP, \fBPRE_EXCLUDE_REGEXES\fP,
\fBPOST_INCLUDE_REGEXES\fP, and \fBPOST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES\fP to properly
filter DLL names \- every regex would have to check for both uppercase
and lowercase letters.  For example:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES
  # ...
  PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES \(dq^[Mm][Yy][Ll][Ii][Bb][Rr][Aa][Rr][Yy]\e\e.[Dd][Ll][Ll]$\(dq
  )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Converting the DLL name to lowercase allows the regexes to only match
lowercase names, thus simplifying the regex. For example:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES
  # ...
  PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES \(dq^mylibrary\e\e.dll$\(dq
  )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This regex will match \fBmylibrary.dll\fP regardless of how it is cased,
either on disk or in the depending file. (For example, it will match
\fBmylibrary.dll\fP, \fBMyLibrary.dll\fP, and \fBMYLIBRARY.DLL\fP\&.)
.sp
Changed in version 3.27: The conversion to lowercase only applies while matching filters.
Results reported after filtering case\-preserve each DLL name as it is
found on disk, if resolved, and otherwise as it is referenced by the
dependent binary.
.sp
Prior to CMake 3.27, the results were reported with lowercase DLL
file names, but the directory portion retained its casing.

.IP 2. 3
(\fBNot yet implemented\fP) If the depending file is a Windows Store app,
and the dependency is listed as a dependency in the application\(aqs package
manifest, the dependency is resolved to that file.
.IP 3. 3
Otherwise, if the library exists in the same directory as the depending
file, the dependency is resolved to that file.
.IP 4. 3
Otherwise, if the library exists in either the operating system\(aqs
\fBsystem32\fP directory or the \fBWindows\fP directory, in that order, the
dependency is resolved to that file.
.IP 5. 3
Otherwise, if the library exists in one of the directories specified by
\fBDIRECTORIES\fP, in the order they are listed, the dependency is resolved
to that file. In this case, a warning is not issued, because searching
other directories is a normal part of Windows library resolution.
.IP 6. 3
Otherwise, the dependency is unresolved.
.UNINDENT
.sp
On Apple platforms, library resolution works as follows:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
If the dependency starts with \fB@executable_path/\fP, and an
\fBEXECUTABLES\fP argument is in the process of being resolved, and
replacing \fB@executable_path/\fP with the directory of the executable
yields an existing file, the dependency is resolved to that file.
.IP 2. 3
Otherwise, if the dependency starts with \fB@executable_path/\fP, and there
is a \fBBUNDLE_EXECUTABLE\fP argument, and replacing \fB@executable_path/\fP
with the directory of the bundle executable yields an existing file, the
dependency is resolved to that file.
.IP 3. 3
Otherwise, if the dependency starts with \fB@loader_path/\fP, and replacing
\fB@loader_path/\fP with the directory of the depending file yields an
existing file, the dependency is resolved to that file.
.IP 4. 3
Otherwise, if the dependency starts with \fB@rpath/\fP, and replacing
\fB@rpath/\fP with one of the \fBRPATH\fP entries of the depending file
yields an existing file, the dependency is resolved to that file.
Note that \fBRPATH\fP entries that start with \fB@executable_path/\fP or
\fB@loader_path/\fP also have these items replaced with the appropriate
path.
.IP 5. 3
Otherwise, if the dependency is an absolute file that exists,
the dependency is resolved to that file.
.IP 6. 3
Otherwise, the dependency is unresolved.

The CMake variable \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP specifies one or more
directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
effectively \(dqre\-roots\(dq the entire search under given locations.
Paths which are descendants of the \fI\%CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX\fP are excluded

By default the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP is empty.

The \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP variable can also be used to specify exactly one

.sp
These variables are especially useful when cross\-compiling to
point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP are searched, then the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP
directory is searched, and then the non\-rooted directories will be
searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE\fP\&.  This behavior can be manually
overridden on a per\-call basis using options:
.INDENT 0.0

where the \fBfind_package()\fP command fits into the bigger picture,
including its relationship to the \fI\%FetchContent\fP module.
The guide is recommended pre\-reading before moving on to the details below.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Find a package (usually provided by something external to the project),
and load its package\-specific details.  Calls to this command can also
be intercepted by \fI\%dependency providers\fP\&.
.SS Typical Usage
.sp
Most calls to \fBfind_package()\fP typically have the following form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
find_package(<PackageName> [<version>] [REQUIRED] [COMPONENTS <components>...])
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB<PackageName>\fP is the only mandatory argument.  The \fB<version>\fP is
often omitted, and \fBREQUIRED\fP should be given if the project cannot be
configured successfully without the package.  Some more complicated packages
support components which can be selected with the \fBCOMPONENTS\fP keyword, but
most packages don\(aqt have that level of complexity.
.sp
The above is a reduced form of the \fI\%basic signature\fP\&.  Where possible,
projects should find packages using this form.  This reduces complexity and
maximizes the ways in which the package can be found or provided.
.sp
Understanding the \fI\%basic signature\fP should be enough for general usage of
\fBfind_package()\fP\&.  Project maintainers who intend to provide a config
package should understand the bigger picture, as explained in
\fI\%Full Signature\fP and all subsequent sections on this page.
.SS Search Modes
.sp
The command has a few modes by which it searches for packages:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBModule mode\fP
In this mode, CMake searches for a file called \fBFind<PackageName>.cmake\fP,
looking first in the locations listed in the \fI\%CMAKE_MODULE_PATH\fP,
then among the \fI\%Find Modules\fP provided by the CMake installation.
If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake.  It is responsible
for finding the package, checking the version, and producing any needed
messages.  Some Find modules provide limited or no support for versioning;
check the Find module\(aqs documentation.
.sp
The \fBFind<PackageName>.cmake\fP file is not typically provided by the
package itself.  Rather, it is normally provided by something external to
the package, such as the operating system, CMake itself, or even the project
from which the \fBfind_package()\fP command was called.  Being externally
provided, \fI\%Find Modules\fP tend to be heuristic in nature and are
susceptible to becoming out\-of\-date.  They typically search for certain
libraries, files and other package artifacts.
.sp
Module mode is only supported by the
\fI\%basic command signature\fP\&.
.TP
\fBConfig mode\fP
In this mode, CMake searches for a file called
\fB<lowercasePackageName>\-config.cmake\fP or \fB<PackageName>Config.cmake\fP\&.
It will also look for \fB<lowercasePackageName>\-config\-version.cmake\fP or
\fB<PackageName>ConfigVersion.cmake\fP if version details were specified
(see \fI\%Config Mode Version Selection\fP for an explanation of how these separate
version files are used).
.sp
In config mode, the command can be given a list of names to search for
as package names.  The locations where CMake searches for the config and
version files is considerably more complicated than for Module mode
(see \fI\%Config Mode Search Procedure\fP).
.sp
The config and version files are typically installed as part of the
package, so they tend to be more reliable than Find modules.  They usually
contain direct knowledge of the package contents, so no searching or
heuristics are needed within the config or version files themselves.
.sp
Config mode is supported by both the \fI\%basic\fP and
\fI\%full\fP command signatures.
.TP
\fBFetchContent redirection mode\fP
New in version 3.24: A call to \fBfind_package()\fP can be redirected internally to a package
provided by the \fI\%FetchContent\fP module.  To the caller, the behavior
will appear similar to Config mode, except that the search logic is
by\-passed and the component information is not used.  See
\fI\%FetchContent_Declare()\fP and \fI\%FetchContent_MakeAvailable()\fP
for further details.

.UNINDENT
.sp
When not redirected to a package provided by \fI\%FetchContent\fP, the
command arguments determine whether Module or Config mode is used.  When the
\fI\%basic signature\fP is used, the command searches in Module mode first.
If the package is not found, the search falls back to Config mode.
A user may set the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG\fP variable
to true to reverse the priority and direct CMake to search using Config mode
first before falling back to Module mode.  The basic signature can also be
forced to use only Module mode with a \fBMODULE\fP keyword.  If the
\fI\%full signature\fP is used, the command only searches in Config mode.

.sp
The basic signature is supported by both Module and Config modes.
The \fBMODULE\fP keyword implies that only Module mode can be used to find
the package, with no fallback to Config mode.
.sp
Regardless of the mode used, a \fB<PackageName>_FOUND\fP variable will be
set to indicate whether the package was found.  When the package is found,
package\-specific information may be provided through other variables and
\fI\%Imported Targets\fP documented by the package itself.  The
\fBQUIET\fP option disables informational messages, including those indicating
that the package cannot be found if it is not \fBREQUIRED\fP\&.  The \fBREQUIRED\fP
option stops processing with an error message if the package cannot be found.
.sp
A package\-specific list of required components may be listed after the
\fBCOMPONENTS\fP keyword.  If any of these components are not able to be
satisfied, the package overall is considered to be not found.  If the
\fBREQUIRED\fP option is also present, this is treated as a fatal error,
otherwise execution still continues.  As a form of shorthand, if the
\fBREQUIRED\fP option is present, the \fBCOMPONENTS\fP keyword can be omitted
and the required components can be listed directly after \fBREQUIRED\fP\&.
.sp
Additional optional components may be listed after
\fBOPTIONAL_COMPONENTS\fP\&.  If these cannot be satisfied, the package overall
can still be considered found, as long as all required components are
satisfied.
.sp
The set of available components and their meaning are defined by the
target package.  Formally, it is up to the target package how to
interpret the component information given to it, but it should follow
the expectations stated above.  For calls where no components are specified,
there is no single expected behavior and target packages should clearly
define what occurs in such cases.  Common arrangements include assuming it
should find all components, no components or some well\-defined subset of the
available components.
.sp
New in version 3.24: The \fBREGISTRY_VIEW\fP keyword specifies which registry views should be
queried. This keyword is only meaningful on \fBWindows\fP platforms and will
be ignored on all others. Formally, it is up to the target package how to
interpret the registry view information given to it.

.sp
New in version 3.24: Specifying the \fBGLOBAL\fP keyword will promote all imported targets to
a global scope in the importing project. Alternatively, this functionality
can be enabled by setting the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_TARGETS_GLOBAL\fP
variable.

.sp
The \fB[version]\fP argument requests a version with which the package found
should be compatible. There are two possible forms in which it may be
specified:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A single version with the format \fBmajor[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]\fP, where
each component is a numeric value.
.IP \(bu 2
A version range with the format \fBversionMin...[<]versionMax\fP where
\fBversionMin\fP and \fBversionMax\fP have the same format and constraints
on components being integers as the single version.  By default, both end
points are included.  By specifying \fB<\fP, the upper end point will be
excluded. Version ranges are only supported with CMake 3.19 or later.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBEXACT\fP option requests that the version be matched exactly. This option
is incompatible with the specification of a version range.
.sp
If no \fB[version]\fP and/or component list is given to a recursive invocation
inside a find\-module, the corresponding arguments are forwarded
automatically from the outer call (including the \fBEXACT\fP flag for
\fB[version]\fP).  Version support is currently provided only on a
package\-by\-package basis (see the \fI\%Version Selection\fP section below).
When a version range is specified but the package is only designed to expect
a single version, the package will ignore the upper end point of the range and
only take the single version at the lower end of the range into account.
.sp
See the \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP command documentation for discussion
of the \fBNO_POLICY_SCOPE\fP option.
.sp
New in version 3.24: The \fBBYPASS_PROVIDER\fP keyword is only allowed when \fBfind_package()\fP is
being called by a \fI\%dependency provider\fP\&.
It can be used by providers to call the built\-in \fBfind_package()\fP
implementation directly and prevent that call from being re\-routed back to
itself.  Future versions of CMake may detect attempts to use this keyword
from places other than a dependency provider and halt with a fatal error.

.sp
The \fBCONFIG\fP option, the synonymous \fBNO_MODULE\fP option, or the use
of options not specified in the \fI\%basic signature\fP all enforce pure Config
mode.  In pure Config mode, the command skips Module mode search and
proceeds at once with Config mode search.
.sp
Config mode search attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the
package to be found.  A cache entry called \fB<PackageName>_DIR\fP is created to
hold the directory containing the file.  By default, the command searches for
a package with the name \fB<PackageName>\fP\&.  If the \fBNAMES\fP option is given,
the names following it are used instead of \fB<PackageName>\fP\&.  The names are
also considered when determining whether to redirect the call to a package
provided by \fI\%FetchContent\fP\&.
.sp
The command searches for a file called \fB<PackageName>Config.cmake\fP or
\fB<lowercasePackageName>\-config.cmake\fP for each name specified.
A replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given
using the \fBCONFIGS\fP option.  The \fI\%Config Mode Search Procedure\fP is specified below.
Once found, any \fI\%version constraint\fP is checked,
and if satisfied, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.
Since the file is provided by the package it already knows the
location of package contents.  The full path to the configuration file
is stored in the cmake variable \fB<PackageName>_CONFIG\fP\&.
.sp
All configuration files which have been considered by CMake while
searching for the package with an appropriate version are stored in the
\fB<PackageName>_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS\fP variable, and the associated versions
in the \fB<PackageName>_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS\fP variable.
.sp
If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate
an error describing the problem unless the \fBQUIET\fP argument is
specified.  If \fBREQUIRED\fP is specified and the package is not found a
fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.  If
\fB<PackageName>_DIR\fP has been set to a directory not containing a
configuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.
.sp
Package maintainers providing CMake package configuration files are
encouraged to name and install them such that the \fI\%Config Mode Search Procedure\fP
outlined below will find them without requiring use of additional options.
.SS Config Mode Search Procedure
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

.sp
New in version 3.24: All calls to \fBfind_package()\fP (even in Module mode) first look for a config
package file in the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR\fP directory.
The \fI\%FetchContent\fP module, or even the project itself, may write files
to that location to redirect \fBfind_package()\fP calls to content already
provided by the project.  If no config package file is found in that location,
the search proceeds with the logic described below.

.sp
CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes for the
package.  Under each prefix several directories are searched for a
configuration file.  The tables below show the directories searched.
Each entry is meant for installation trees following Windows (\fBW\fP), UNIX

typically include installed software. An example being \fB/usr/local\fP for
UNIX based platforms.
.IP 8. 3
Search paths stored in the CMake \fI\%System Package Registry\fP\&.
This can be skipped if \fBNO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP is passed

variable to \fBFALSE\fP or the deprecated variable
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY\fP to \fBTRUE\fP\&.
.sp
See the \fI\%cmake\-packages(7)\fP manual for details on the system

The \fI\%CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH\fP, \fI\%CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH\fP variables can also cause some
of the above locations to be ignored.
.sp
New in version 3.16: Added the \fBCMAKE_FIND_USE_<CATEGORY>\fP variables to globally disable
various search locations.

.sp
The CMake variable \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP specifies one or more
directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
effectively \(dqre\-roots\(dq the entire search under given locations.
Paths which are descendants of the \fI\%CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX\fP are excluded
from this re\-rooting, because that variable is always a path on the host system.
By default the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP is empty.
.sp
The \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP variable can also be used to specify exactly one
directory to use as a prefix.  Setting \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP also has other
effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.
.sp
These variables are especially useful when cross\-compiling to
point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP are searched, then the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP
directory is searched, and then the non\-rooted directories will be
searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE\fP\&.  This behavior can be manually
overridden on a per\-call basis using options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH\fP
Search in the order described above.
.TP
.B \fBNO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP
Do not use the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fBONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP
Search only the re\-rooted directories and directories below
\fI\%CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default search order is designed to be most\-specific to
least\-specific for common use cases.
Projects may override the order by simply calling the command
multiple times and using the \fBNO_*\fP options:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
find_package (<PackageName> PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
find_package (<PackageName>)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set
and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.
.sp
By default the value stored in the result variable will be the path at
which the file is found.  The \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS\fP
variable may be set to \fBTRUE\fP before calling \fBfind_package\fP in order
to resolve symbolic links and store the real path to the file.
.sp
Every non\-REQUIRED \fBfind_package\fP call can be disabled or made REQUIRED:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Setting the \fI\%CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>\fP variable
to \fBTRUE\fP disables the package.  This also disables redirection to a
package provided by \fI\%FetchContent\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Setting the \fI\%CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>\fP variable
to \fBTRUE\fP makes the package REQUIRED.
.UNINDENT

Setting both variables to \fBTRUE\fP simultaneously is an error.
.SS Config Mode Version Selection

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When the \fB[version]\fP argument is given, Config mode will only find a
version of the package that claims compatibility with the requested
version (see \fI\%format specification\fP). If the
\fBEXACT\fP option is given, only a version of the package claiming an exact match
of the requested version may be found.  CMake does not establish any
convention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package version
numbers are checked by \(dqversion\(dq files provided by the packages themselves
or by \fI\%FetchContent\fP\&.  For a candidate package configuration file
\fB<config\-file>.cmake\fP the corresponding version file is located next
to it and named either \fB<config\-file>\-version.cmake\fP or
\fB<config\-file>Version.cmake\fP\&.  If no such version file is available
then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any
requested version.  A basic version file containing generic version
matching code can be created using the
\fI\%CMakePackageConfigHelpers\fP module.  When a version file
is found it is loaded to check the requested version number.  The
version file is loaded in a nested scope in which the following
variables have been defined:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBPACKAGE_FIND_NAME\fP
The \fB<PackageName>\fP
.TP
.B \fBPACKAGE_FIND_VERSION\fP

.UNINDENT
.sp
When a version range is specified, the above version variables will hold
values based on the lower end of the version range.  This is to preserve
compatibility with packages that have not been implemented to expect version
ranges.  In addition, the version range will be described by the following
variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBPACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_RANGE\fP
Full requested version range string
.TP
.B \fBPACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_RANGE_MIN\fP
This specifies whether the lower end point of the version range should be
included or excluded.  Currently, the only supported value for this variable
is \fBINCLUDE\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBPACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_RANGE_MAX\fP
This specifies whether the upper end point of the version range should be
included or excluded.  The supported values for this variable are
\fBINCLUDE\fP and \fBEXCLUDE\fP\&.

Regardless of whether a single version or a version range is specified, the
variable \fBPACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COMPLETE\fP will be defined and will hold
the full requested version string as specified.
.sp
The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and
sets these variables:
.INDENT 0.0

True if version is compatible
.TP
.B \fBPACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE\fP
True if unsuitable as any version
.UNINDENT
.sp
These variables are checked by the \fBfind_package\fP command to determine
whether the configuration file provides an acceptable version.  They
are not available after the \fBfind_package\fP call returns.  If the version
is acceptable the following variables are set:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB<PackageName>_VERSION\fP
Full provided version string

and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.
When multiple package configuration files are available whose version files
claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspecified which
one is chosen: unless the variable \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER\fP
is set no attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version number.
.sp
To control the order in which \fBfind_package\fP checks for compatibility use
the two variables \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION\fP\&.
For instance in order to select the highest version one can set

.sp
On macOS the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE\fP variables determine the order of
preference between Apple\-style and unix\-style package components.
.sp
The CMake variable \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP specifies one or more
directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
effectively \(dqre\-roots\(dq the entire search under given locations.
Paths which are descendants of the \fI\%CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX\fP are excluded
from this re\-rooting, because that variable is always a path on the host system.
By default the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP is empty.
.sp
The \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP variable can also be used to specify exactly one
directory to use as a prefix.  Setting \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP also has other
effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.
.sp
These variables are especially useful when cross\-compiling to
point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP are searched, then the \fI\%CMAKE_SYSROOT\fP
directory is searched, and then the non\-rooted directories will be
searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
\fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE\fP\&.  This behavior can be manually
overridden on a per\-call basis using options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH\fP
Search in the order described above.
.TP
.B \fBNO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP
Do not use the \fI\%CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fBONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\fP
Search only the re\-rooted directories and directories below
\fI\%CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default search order is designed to be most\-specific to
least\-specific for common use cases.
Projects may override the order by simply calling the command
multiple times and using the \fBNO_*\fP options:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set
and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.
.sp
When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as \fBA/b.h\fP, then
the framework search will look for \fBA.framework/Headers/b.h\fP\&.  If that
is found the path will be set to the path to the framework.  CMake
will convert this to the correct \fB\-F\fP option to include the file.

are recorded; they are not executed until the function is invoked.
.sp
Per legacy, the \fI\%endfunction()\fP command admits an optional
\fB<name>\fP argument. If used, it must be a verbatim repeat of the
argument of the opening \fBfunction\fP command.
.sp
A function opens a new scope: see \fI\%set(var PARENT_SCOPE)\fP for
details.

See the \fI\%cmake_policy()\fP command documentation for the behavior
of policies inside functions.
.sp
See the \fI\%macro()\fP command documentation for differences

.SS Invocation
.sp
The function invocation is case\-insensitive. A function defined as
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(foo)
  <commands>
endfunction()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
can be invoked through any of
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
foo()
Foo()
FOO()
cmake_language(CALL foo)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and so on. However, it is strongly recommended to stay with the
case chosen in the function definition. Typically functions use
all\-lowercase names.
.sp
New in version 3.18: The \fI\%cmake_language(CALL ...)\fP command can also be used to
invoke the function.

.SS Arguments
.sp
When the function is invoked, the recorded \fB<commands>\fP are first
modified by replacing formal parameters (\fB${arg1}\fP, ...) with the
arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands.
.sp
In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the
\fBARGC\fP variable which will be set to the number of arguments passed
into the function as well as \fBARGV0\fP, \fBARGV1\fP, \fBARGV2\fP, ...  which
will have the actual values of the arguments passed in.  This facilitates
creating functions with optional arguments.
.sp
Furthermore, \fBARGV\fP holds the list of all arguments given to the
function and \fBARGN\fP holds the list of arguments past the last expected
argument.  Referencing to \fBARGV#\fP arguments beyond \fBARGC\fP have
undefined behavior.  Checking that \fBARGC\fP is greater than \fB#\fP is
the only way to ensure that \fBARGV#\fP was passed to the function as an
extra argument.

also supports the \fI\%VARIABLES\fP and \fI\%MACROS\fP directory
properties.  It also supports a special \fBCOMPONENTS\fP global property that

The if command was written very early in CMake\(aqs history, predating
the \fB${}\fP variable evaluation syntax, and for convenience evaluates
variables named by its arguments as shown in the above signatures.

Sets up an include guard for the current CMake file (see the

.sp
CMake will end its processing of the current file at the location of the
\fBinclude_guard\fP command if the current file has already been
processed for the applicable scope (see below). This provides functionality
similar to the include guards commonly used in source headers or to the
\fB#pragma once\fP directive. If the current file has been processed previously
for the applicable scope, the effect is as though \fI\%return()\fP had been
called. Do not call this command from inside a function being defined within
the current file.
.sp
An optional argument specifying the scope of the guard may be provided.
Possible values for the option are:
.INDENT 0.0

The include guard applies within the current directory and below. The file
will only be included once within this directory scope, but may be included
again by other files outside of this directory (i.e. a parent directory or
another directory not pulled in by \fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP or

\fI\%SORT\fP may create new values for the list within the current CMake
variable scope.  Similar to the \fI\%set()\fP command, the \fBlist\fP command
creates new variable values in the current scope, even if the list itself is
actually defined in a parent scope.  To propagate the results of these
operations upwards, use \fI\%set()\fP with \fBPARENT_SCOPE\fP,
\fI\%set()\fP with \fBCACHE INTERNAL\fP, or some other means of value
propagation.

\fBNOTE:\fP

.INDENT 3.5
A list in cmake is a \fB;\fP separated group of strings.  To create a
list, the \fI\%set()\fP command can be used.  For example,
\fBset(var a b c d e)\fP creates a list with \fBa;b;c;d;e\fP, and
\fBset(var \(dqa b c d e\(dq)\fP creates a string or a list with one item in it.
(Note that macro arguments are not variables, and therefore cannot be used
in \fBLIST\fP commands.)
.sp
Individual elements may not contain an unequal number of \fB[\fP and \fB]\fP
characters, and may not end in a backslash (\fB\e\fP).
See \fI\%semicolon\-separated lists\fP for details.

When specifying index values, if \fB<element index>\fP is 0 or greater, it
is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the
first list element.  If \fB<element index>\fP is \-1 or lesser, it is indexed
from the end of the list, with \-1 representing the last list element.
Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from
0.  \-0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.

and so on. However, it is strongly recommended to stay with the
case chosen in the macro definition.  Typically macros use
all\-lowercase names.
.sp
New in version 3.18: The \fI\%cmake_language(CALL ...)\fP command can also be used to
invoke the macro.

.SS Arguments
.sp
When a macro is invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are
first modified by replacing formal parameters (\fB${arg1}\fP, ...)
with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands.
.sp
In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the
values \fB${ARGC}\fP which will be set to the number of arguments passed
into the macro as well as \fB${ARGV0}\fP, \fB${ARGV1}\fP, \fB${ARGV2}\fP,
\&...  which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in.
This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments.
.sp
Furthermore, \fB${ARGV}\fP holds the list of all arguments given to the
macro and \fB${ARGN}\fP holds the list of arguments past the last expected
argument.
Referencing to \fB${ARGV#}\fP arguments beyond \fB${ARGC}\fP have undefined
behavior. Checking that \fB${ARGC}\fP is greater than \fB#\fP is the only
way to ensure that \fB${ARGV#}\fP was passed to the function as an extra
argument.
.SS Macro vs Function
.sp
The \fBmacro\fP command is very similar to the \fI\%function()\fP command.
Nonetheless, there are a few important differences.
.sp
In a function, \fBARGN\fP, \fBARGC\fP, \fBARGV\fP and \fBARGV0\fP, \fBARGV1\fP, ...
are true variables in the usual CMake sense.  In a macro, they are not,
they are string replacements much like the C preprocessor would do
with a macro.  This has a number of consequences, as explained in
the \fI\%Argument Caveats\fP section below.
.sp
Another difference between macros and functions is the control flow.
A function is executed by transferring control from the calling
statement to the function body.  A macro is executed as if the macro
body were pasted in place of the calling statement.  This has the
consequence that a \fI\%return()\fP in a macro body does not
just terminate execution of the macro; rather, control is returned
from the scope of the macro call.  To avoid confusion, it is recommended
to avoid \fI\%return()\fP in macros altogether.
.sp
Unlike a function, the \fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE\fP,
\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE\fP variables are not
set for a macro.
.SS Argument Caveats
.sp
Since \fBARGN\fP, \fBARGC\fP, \fBARGV\fP, \fBARGV0\fP etc. are not variables,
you will NOT be able to use commands like
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if(ARGV1) # ARGV1 is not a variable
if(DEFINED ARGV2) # ARGV2 is not a variable
if(ARGC GREATER 2) # ARGC is not a variable
foreach(loop_var IN LISTS ARGN) # ARGN is not a variable
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the first case, you can use \fBif(${ARGV1})\fP\&.  In the second and
third case, the proper way to check if an optional variable was
passed to the macro is to use \fBif(${ARGC} GREATER 2)\fP\&.  In the
last case, you can use \fBforeach(loop_var ${ARGN})\fP but this will
skip empty arguments.  If you need to include them, you can use
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(list_var \(dq${ARGN}\(dq)
foreach(loop_var IN LISTS list_var)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that if you have a variable with the same name in the scope from
which the macro is called, using unreferenced names will use the
existing variable instead of the arguments. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
macro(bar)
  foreach(arg IN LISTS ARGN)
    <commands>
  endforeach()
endmacro()

function(foo)
  bar(x y z)
endfunction()

foo(a b c)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Will loop over \fBa;b;c\fP and not over \fBx;y;z\fP as one might have expected.
If you want true CMake variables and/or better CMake scope control you
should look at the function command.

.sp
If the keyword \fBCLEAR\fP is given
then advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced.
If the keyword \fBFORCE\fP is given
then the variables are made advanced.
If neither \fBFORCE\fP nor \fBCLEAR\fP is specified,
new values will be marked as advanced, but if a
variable already has an advanced/non\-advanced state,
it will not be changed.

should provide additional details that won\(aqt be of interest in most cases,
but which may be useful to those building the project when they want deeper
insight into what\(aqs happening.
.TP
.B \fBDEBUG\fP
Detailed informational messages intended for developers working on the
project itself as opposed to users who just want to build it.  These messages
will not typically be of interest to other users building the project and
will often be closely related to internal implementation details.
.TP
.B \fBTRACE\fP
Fine\-grained messages with very low\-level implementation details.  Messages
using this log level would normally only be temporary and would expect to be
removed before releasing the project, packaging up the files, etc.
.UNINDENT
.sp
New in version 3.15: Added the \fBNOTICE\fP, \fBVERBOSE\fP, \fBDEBUG\fP, and \fBTRACE\fP levels.

.sp
The CMake command\-line tool displays \fBSTATUS\fP to \fBTRACE\fP messages on stdout
with the message preceded by two hyphens and a space.  All other message types
are sent to stderr and are not prefixed with hyphens.  The
\fI\%CMake GUI\fP displays all messages in its log area.
The \fI\%curses interface\fP shows \fBSTATUS\fP to \fBTRACE\fP
messages one at a time on a status line and other messages in an
interactive pop\-up box.  The \fI\%\-\-log\-level\fP
command\-line option to each of these tools can be used to control which
messages will be shown.
.sp
New in version 3.17: To make a log level persist between CMake runs, the
\fI\%CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL\fP variable can be set instead.
Note that the command line option takes precedence over the cache variable.

.sp
New in version 3.16: Messages of log levels \fBNOTICE\fP and below will have each line preceded
by the content of the \fI\%CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT\fP variable (converted to
a single string by concatenating its list items).  For \fBSTATUS\fP to \fBTRACE\fP
messages, this indenting content will be inserted after the hyphens.

.sp
New in version 3.17: Messages of log levels \fBNOTICE\fP and below can also have each line preceded
with context of the form \fB[some.context.example]\fP\&.  The content between the
square brackets is obtained by converting the \fI\%CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT\fP
list variable to a dot\-separated string.  The message context will always
appear before any indenting content but after any automatically added leading
hyphens. By default, message context is not shown, it has to be explicitly
enabled by giving the \fI\%cmake \-\-log\-context\fP
command\-line option or by setting the \fI\%CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW\fP
variable to true.  See the \fI\%CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT\fP documentation for
usage examples.

.sp
CMake Warning and Error message text displays using a simple markup
language.  Non\-indented text is formatted in line\-wrapped paragraphs
delimited by newlines.  Indented text is considered pre\-formatted.
.SS Reporting checks
.sp
New in version 3.17.

.sp
A common pattern in CMake output is a message indicating the start of some
sort of check, followed by another message reporting the result of that check.
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
message(STATUS \(dqLooking for someheader.h\(dq)
#... do the checks, set checkSuccess with the result
if(checkSuccess)
  message(STATUS \(dqLooking for someheader.h \- found\(dq)
else()
  message(STATUS \(dqLooking for someheader.h \- not found\(dq)
endif()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This can be more robustly and conveniently expressed using the \fBCHECK_...\fP
keyword form of the \fBmessage()\fP command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
message(<checkState> \(dqmessage\(dq ...)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fB<checkState>\fP must be one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBCHECK_START\fP
Record a concise message about the check about to be performed.
.TP
.B \fBCHECK_PASS\fP
Record a successful result for a check.
.TP
.B \fBCHECK_FAIL\fP
Record an unsuccessful result for a check.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When recording a check result, the command repeats the message from the most
recently started check for which no result has yet been reported, then some
separator characters and then the message text provided after the
\fBCHECK_PASS\fP or \fBCHECK_FAIL\fP keyword.  Check messages are always reported
at \fBSTATUS\fP log level.
.sp
Checks may be nested and every \fBCHECK_START\fP should have exactly one
matching \fBCHECK_PASS\fP or \fBCHECK_FAIL\fP\&.
The \fI\%CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT\fP variable can also be used to add
indenting to nested checks if desired.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
message(CHECK_START \(dqFinding my things\(dq)
list(APPEND CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT \(dq  \(dq)
unset(missingComponents)

message(CHECK_START \(dqFinding partA\(dq)
# ... do check, assume we find A
message(CHECK_PASS \(dqfound\(dq)

message(CHECK_START \(dqFinding partB\(dq)
# ... do check, assume we don\(aqt find B
list(APPEND missingComponents B)
message(CHECK_FAIL \(dqnot found\(dq)

list(POP_BACK CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT)
if(missingComponents)
  message(CHECK_FAIL \(dqmissing components: ${missingComponents}\(dq)
else()
  message(CHECK_PASS \(dqall components found\(dq)
endif()
.ft P

deferred calls scheduled by \fI\%cmake_language(DEFER)\fP are invoked and
control is returned to the parent directory if there is one.
.sp
If \fBreturn()\fP is called in a function, control is returned to the caller

with the \fI\%block()\fP command, as described below.
.sp
The \fBPROPAGATE\fP option can be very useful in conjunction with the
\fI\%block()\fP command.  A \fBreturn\fP will propagate the
specified variables through any enclosing block scopes created by the
\fI\%block()\fP commands.  Inside a function, this ensures the variables
are propagated to the function\(aqs caller, regardless of any blocks within
the function.  If not inside a function, it ensures the variables are

If the \fBPARENT_SCOPE\fP option is given the variable will be set in
the scope above the current scope.  Each new directory or \fI\%function()\fP

of a variable into the parent directory, calling function, or
encompassing scope (whichever is applicable to the case at hand).
The previous state of the variable\(aqs value stays the same in the
current scope (e.g., if it was undefined before, it is still undefined
and if it had a value, it is still that value).

When evaluating \fI\%Variable References\fP of the form \fB${VAR}\fP, CMake
first searches for a normal variable with that name.  If no such normal
variable exists, CMake will then search for a cache entry with that name.
Because of this, \fBunsetting a normal variable can expose a cache variable
that was previously hidden\fP\&.  To force a variable reference of the form
\fB${VAR}\fP to return an empty string, use \fBset(<variable> \(dq\(dq)\fP, which
clears the normal variable but leaves it defined.

Matches any character(s) not inside the brackets.
To not match a literal \fB]\fP, make it the first character, e.g., \fB[^]ab]\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\fP
Inside brackets, specifies an inclusive range between characters on
either side, e.g., \fB[a\-f]\fP is \fB[abcdef]\fP\&.
To match a literal \fB\-\fP using brackets, make it the first or the last
character, e.g., \fB[+*/\-]\fP matches basic mathematical operators.

.TP
.B \fB+\fP
Matches preceding pattern one or more times

.IP \(bu 2
The quoted argument \fB\(dq\e\e(\e\ea\e\e+b\e\e)\(dq\fP specifies a regex that matches
the exact string \fB(a+b)\fP\&.  Each \fB\e\e\fP is parsed in a quoted argument
as just \fB\e\fP, so the regex itself is actually \fB\e(\ea\e+\eb\e)\fP\&.  This

Explicit specification of byproducts is supported by the

how to regenerate byproducts when they are missing.  It is
also useful when other build rules (e.g. custom commands)
depend on the byproducts.  Ninja requires a build rule for any
generated file on which another rule depends even if there are
order\-only dependencies to ensure the byproducts will be
available before their dependents build.
.sp

.B \fBDEPENDS\fP
Specify files on which the command depends.  Each argument is converted
to a dependency as follows:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
If the argument is the name of a target (created by the
\fI\%add_custom_target()\fP, \fI\%add_executable()\fP, or
\fI\%add_library()\fP command) a target\-level dependency is
created to make sure the target is built before any target
using this custom command.  Additionally, if the target is an
executable or library, a file\-level dependency is created to
cause the custom command to re\-run whenever the target is
recompiled.
.IP 2. 3
If the argument is an absolute path, a file\-level dependency
is created on that path.
.IP 3. 3
If the argument is the name of a source file that has been
added to a target or on which a source file property has been set,
a file\-level dependency is created on that source file.
.IP 4. 3
If the argument is a relative path and it exists in the current
source directory, a file\-level dependency is created on that
file in the current source directory.
.IP 5. 3
Otherwise, a file\-level dependency is created on that path relative
to the current binary directory.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If any dependency is an \fBOUTPUT\fP of another custom command in the same

New in version 3.16: A target\-level dependency is added if any dependency is listed as
\fBBYPRODUCTS\fP of a target or any of its build events in the same

.sp
If \fBDEPENDS\fP is not specified, the command will run whenever
the \fBOUTPUT\fP is missing; if the command does not actually

.B \fBIMPLICIT_DEPENDS\fP
Request scanning of implicit dependencies of an input file.
The language given specifies the programming language whose
corresponding dependency scanner should be used.
Currently only \fBC\fP and \fBCXX\fP language scanners are supported.
The language has to be specified for every file in the

.B \fBMAIN_DEPENDENCY\fP
Specify the primary input source file to the command.  This is
treated just like any value given to the \fBDEPENDS\fP option
but also suggests to Visual Studio generators where to hang
the custom command. Each source file may have at most one command
specifying it as its main dependency. A compile command (i.e. for a
library or an executable) counts as an implicit main dependency which
gets silently overwritten by a custom command specification.
.TP
.B \fBOUTPUT\fP
Specify the output files the command is expected to produce.
Each output file will be marked with the \fI\%GENERATED\fP
source file property automatically.
If the output of the custom command is not actually created
as a file on disk it should be marked with the \fI\%SYMBOLIC\fP
source file property.
.sp
If an output file name is a relative path, its absolute path is
determined by interpreting it relative to:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
the build directory corresponding to the current source directory
(\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP), or
.IP 2. 3
the current source directory (\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR\fP).
.UNINDENT

The path in the build directory is preferred unless the path in the

The command will be given direct access to the terminal if possible.
With the \fI\%Ninja\fP generator, this places the command in

.TP
.B \fBVERBATIM\fP
All arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the
build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument
unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the
CMake language processor before add_custom_command even sees the
arguments.  Use of \fBVERBATIM\fP is recommended as it enables
correct behavior.  When \fBVERBATIM\fP is not given the behavior
is platform specific because there is no protection of
tool\-specific special characters.
.TP
.B \fBWORKING_DIRECTORY\fP
Execute the command with the given current working directory.
If it is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the
build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory.
.sp
New in version 3.13: Arguments to \fBWORKING_DIRECTORY\fP may use
\fI\%generator expressions\fP\&.

.TP

usually emitted by the custom command itself.  This keyword may only be used
if the generator supports it, as detailed below.
.sp
The expected format, compatible with what is generated by \fBgcc\fP with the

.SS Example: Generating Files for Multiple Targets
.sp
If multiple independent targets need the same custom command output,
it must be attached to a single custom target on which they all depend.
Consider the following example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT table.csv
  COMMAND makeTable \-i ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.dat

add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT foo.cxx
  COMMAND genFromTable \-i table.csv \-case foo \-o foo.cxx

  VERBATIM)
add_library(bar bar.cxx)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Output \fBfoo.cxx\fP is needed only by target \fBfoo\fP and output \fBbar.cxx\fP
is needed only by target \fBbar\fP, but \fIboth\fP targets need \fBtable.csv\fP,
transitively.  Since \fBfoo\fP and \fBbar\fP are independent targets that may
build concurrently, we prevent them from racing to generate \fBtable.csv\fP
by placing its custom command in a separate target, \fBgenerate_table_csv\fP\&.
The custom commands generating \fBfoo.cxx\fP and \fBbar.cxx\fP each specify a
target\-level dependency on \fBgenerate_table_csv\fP, so the targets using them,
\fBfoo\fP and \fBbar\fP, will not build until after target \fBgenerate_table_csv\fP

To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix and \fB,\fP separator can be used to specify, in a portable
way, options to pass to the linker tool. \fBLINKER:\fP is replaced by the
appropriate driver option and \fB,\fP by the appropriate driver separator.
The driver prefix and driver separator are given by the values of the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP\fP variables.
.sp
For example, \fB\(dqLINKER:\-z,defs\(dq\fP becomes \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fP for
\fBClang\fP and \fB\-Wl,\-z,defs\fP for \fBGNU GCC\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix can be specified as part of a \fBSHELL:\fP prefix
expression.
.sp
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of
arguments using the \fBSHELL:\fP prefix and space as separator. The previous
example then becomes \fB\(dqLINKER:SHELL:\-z defs\(dq\fP\&.
.sp

.sp
Adds a subdirectory to the build.  The \fBsource_dir\fP specifies the
directory in which the source \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP and code files are
located.  If it is a relative path, it will be evaluated with respect
to the current directory (the typical usage), but it may also be an
absolute path.  The \fBbinary_dir\fP specifies the directory in which to
place the output files.  If it is a relative path, it will be evaluated
with respect to the current output directory, but it may also be an
absolute path.  If \fBbinary_dir\fP is not specified, the value of
\fBsource_dir\fP, before expanding any relative path, will be used (the
typical usage).  The \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file in the specified source
directory will be processed immediately by CMake before processing in
the current input file continues beyond this command.
.sp
If the \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP argument is provided then the
\fI\%EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP property will be set on the added directory.
This will exclude the directory from a default build. See the directory
property \fI\%EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP for full details.
.sp
New in version 3.25: If the \fBSYSTEM\fP argument is provided, the \fI\%SYSTEM\fP directory
property of the subdirectory will be set to true.  This property is
used to initialize the \fI\%SYSTEM\fP property of each non\-imported
target created in that subdirectory.

If the test command exits with code \fB0\fP the test passes. Non\-zero exit code
is a \(dqfailed\(dq test. The test property \fI\%WILL_FAIL\fP inverts this
logic. Note that system\-level test failures such as segmentation faults or
heap errors will still fail the test even if \fBWILL_FAIL\fP is true. Output
written to stdout or stderr is captured by \fI\%ctest(1)\fP and only
affects the pass/fail status via the \fI\%PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP,
\fI\%FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP, or \fI\%SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP
test properties.

Collects the names of all the source files in the specified directory

intended to be used by projects that use explicit template
instantiation.  Template instantiation files can be stored in a
\fBTemplates\fP subdirectory and collected automatically using this
command to avoid manually listing all instantiations.
.sp
It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source
files for a library or executable target.  While this seems to work,
there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a
new source file has been added.  Normally the generated build system
knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file is
modified to add a new source.  When the source is just added to the
directory without modifying this file, one would have to manually
rerun CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new file.

Each of the optional keywords \fBCODEMODEL\fP, \fBCACHE\fP, \fBCMAKEFILES\fP and
\fBTOOLCHAINS\fP correspond to one of the object kinds that can be requested

\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file.
.sp
For each of the optional keywords, the \fB<versions>\fP list must contain one
or more version values of the form \fBmajor\fP or \fBmajor.minor\fP, where
\fBmajor\fP and \fBminor\fP are integers.  Projects should list the versions they
accept in their preferred order, as only the first supported value from the
list will be selected.  The command will ignore versions with a \fBmajor\fP
version higher than any major version it supports for that object kind.
It will raise an error if it encounters an invalid version number, or if none
of the requested versions is supported.
.sp
For each type of object kind requested, a query equivalent to a shared,
stateless query will be added internally.  No query file will be created in
the file system.  The reply \fIwill\fP be written to the file system at
generation time.

It is not an error to add a query for the same thing more than once, whether

A project may want to use replies from the file API at build time to implement
some form of verification task.  Instead of relying on something outside of
CMake to create a query file, the project can use \fBcmake_file_api(QUERY)\fP

a custom command to run at build time, knowing that the requested information

Defines one property in a scope for use with the \fI\%set_property()\fP and

a property is initialized or inherited. Historically, the command also
associated documentation with a property, but that is no longer considered a
primary use case.

Note that unlike \fI\%set_property()\fP and \fI\%get_property()\fP no
actual scope needs to be given; only the kind of scope is important.
.sp
The required \fBPROPERTY\fP option is immediately followed by the name of
the property being defined.
.sp
If the \fBINHERITED\fP option is given, then the \fI\%get_property()\fP command
will chain up to the next higher scope when the requested property is not set
in the scope given to the command.
.INDENT 0.0

\fBDIRECTORY\fP scope chains to its parent directory\(aqs scope, continuing the

\fI\%get_target_property()\fP, \fI\%get_source_file_property()\fP and
\fI\%get_test_property()\fP\&.  There is no inheriting behavior when \fIsetting\fP

out the contents to append to.
.sp
The \fBBRIEF_DOCS\fP and \fBFULL_DOCS\fP options are followed by strings to be
associated with the property as its brief and full documentation.
CMake does not use this documentation other than making it available to the
project via corresponding options to the \fI\%get_property()\fP command.
.sp
Changed in version 3.23: The \fBBRIEF_DOCS\fP and \fBFULL_DOCS\fP options are optional.

.sp
New in version 3.23: The \fBINITIALIZE_FROM_VARIABLE\fP option specifies a variable from which the
property should be initialized. It can only be used with target properties.
The \fB<variable>\fP name must end with the property name and must not begin
with \fBCMAKE_\fP or \fB_CMAKE_\fP\&. The property name must contain at least one
underscore. It is recommended that the property name have a prefix specific
to the project.

.SS Property Redefinition
.sp
Once a property is defined for a particular type of scope, it cannot be
redefined. Attempts to redefine an existing property by calling
\fI\%define_property()\fP with the same scope type and property name
will be silently ignored. Defining the same property name for two different
kinds of scope is valid.
.sp
\fI\%get_property()\fP can be used to determine whether a property is
already defined for a particular kind of scope, and if so, to examine its
definition. For example:

Creates a file \fB<filename>\fP that may be included by outside projects to

This signature exports cmake built targets to the android ndk build system

registry that this command creates works only in conjunction with a
package configuration file (\fB<PackageName>Config.cmake\fP) that works with the

outside the source and build trees.  Set the

.SS Introduction
.sp
This command generates installation rules for a project.  Install rules
specified by calls to the \fBinstall()\fP command within a source directory
are executed in order during installation.
.sp
Changed in version 3.14: Install rules in subdirectories
added by calls to the \fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP command are interleaved
with those in the parent directory to run in the order declared (see
policy \fI\%CMP0082\fP).

.sp
Changed in version 3.22: The environment variable \fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE\fP can override the
default copying behavior of \fBinstall()\fP\&.

.sp
There are multiple signatures for this command.  Some of them define
installation options for files and targets.  Options common to
multiple signatures are covered here but they are valid only for
signatures that specify them.  The common options are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBDESTINATION <dir>\fP
Specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.
\fB<dir>\fP should be a relative path.  An absolute path is allowed,
but not recommended.
.sp
When a relative path is given it is interpreted relative to the value
of the \fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP variable.
The prefix can be relocated at install time using the \fBDESTDIR\fP
mechanism explained in the \fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP variable
documentation.
.sp
As absolute paths do not work with the \fBcmake \-\-install\fP command\(aqs
\fI\%\-\-prefix\fP option, or with the
\fI\%cpack\fP installer generators, it is strongly recommended
to use relative paths throughout for best support by package maintainers.
In particular, there is no need to make paths absolute by prepending
\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP; this prefix is used by default if
the DESTINATION is a relative path.
.sp
If an absolute path (with a leading slash or drive letter) is given
it is used verbatim.
.TP
.B \fBPERMISSIONS <permission>...\fP
Specify permissions for installed files.  Valid permissions are
\fBOWNER_READ\fP, \fBOWNER_WRITE\fP, \fBOWNER_EXECUTE\fP, \fBGROUP_READ\fP,
\fBGROUP_WRITE\fP, \fBGROUP_EXECUTE\fP, \fBWORLD_READ\fP, \fBWORLD_WRITE\fP,
\fBWORLD_EXECUTE\fP, \fBSETUID\fP, and \fBSETGID\fP\&.  Permissions that do
not make sense on certain platforms are ignored on those platforms.
.sp
If this option is used multiple times in a single call, its list
of permissions accumulates.  If an \fI\%install(TARGETS)\fP call
uses \fI\%<artifact\-kind>\fP arguments, a separate list of permissions
is accumulated for each kind of artifact.
.TP
.B \fBCONFIGURATIONS <config>...\fP
Specify a list of build configurations for which the install rule
applies (Debug, Release, etc.).
.sp
If this option is used multiple times in a single call, its list
of configurations accumulates.  If an \fI\%install(TARGETS)\fP
call uses \fI\%<artifact\-kind>\fP arguments, a separate list of
configurations is accumulated for each kind of artifact.
.TP
.B \fBCOMPONENT <component>\fP
Specify an installation component name with which the install rule
is associated, such as \fBRuntime\fP or \fBDevelopment\fP\&.  During
component\-specific installation only install rules associated with
the given component name will be executed.  During a full installation
all components are installed unless marked with \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP\&.
If \fBCOMPONENT\fP is not provided a default component \(dqUnspecified\(dq is
created.  The default component name may be controlled with the
\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP
New in version 3.6.

.sp
Specify that the file is excluded from a full installation and only
installed as part of a component\-specific installation
.TP
.B \fBRENAME <name>\fP
Specify a name for an installed file that may be different from the
original file.  Renaming is allowed only when a single file is
installed by the command.
.TP
.B \fBOPTIONAL\fP
Specify that it is not an error if the file to be installed does
not exist.
.UNINDENT
.sp
New in version 3.1: Command signatures that install files may print messages during
installation.  Use the \fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE\fP variable
to control which messages are printed.

.sp
New in version 3.11: Many of the \fBinstall()\fP variants implicitly create the directories
containing the installed files. If
\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS\fP is set, these
directories will be created with the permissions specified. Otherwise,
they will be created according to the uname rules on Unix\-like platforms.
Windows platforms are unaffected.

any files in the set are installed under the destination (see below).
The directory structure relative to the file set\(aqs base directories is
preserved. For example, a file added to the file set as
\fB/blah/include/myproj/here.h\fP with a base directory \fB/blah/include\fP
would be installed to \fBmyproj/here.h\fP below the destination.

.sp
Any module files from C++ modules from \fBPUBLIC\fP sources in a file set of
type \fBCXX_MODULES\fP will be installed to the given \fBDESTINATION\fP\&. All
modules are placed directly in the destination as no directory structure is
derived from the names of the modules. An empty \fBDESTINATION\fP may be used
to suppress installing these files (for use in generic code).
.UNINDENT
.sp
For regular executables, static libraries and shared libraries, the
\fBDESTINATION\fP argument is not required.  For these target types, when
\fBDESTINATION\fP is omitted, a default destination will be taken from the
appropriate variable from \fI\%GNUInstallDirs\fP, or set to a built\-in
default value if that variable is not defined.  The same is true for file
sets, and the public and private headers associated with the installed
targets through the \fI\%PUBLIC_HEADER\fP and \fI\%PRIVATE_HEADER\fP
target properties. A destination must always be provided for module libraries,
Apple bundles and frameworks.  A destination can be omitted for interface and
object libraries, but they are handled differently (see the discussion of this
topic toward the end of this section).
.sp
For shared libraries on DLL platforms, if neither \fBRUNTIME\fP nor \fBARCHIVE\fP
destinations are specified, both the \fBRUNTIME\fP and \fBARCHIVE\fP components are
installed to their default destinations. If either a \fBRUNTIME\fP or \fBARCHIVE\fP
destination is specified, the component is installed to that destination, and
the other component is not installed. If both \fBRUNTIME\fP and \fBARCHIVE\fP
destinations are specified, then both components are installed to their
respective destinations.

Projects wishing to follow the common practice of installing headers into a
project\-specific subdirectory may prefer using file sets with appropriate
paths and base directories. Otherwise, they must provide a \fBDESTINATION\fP
instead of being able to rely on the above (see next example below).
.sp
To make packages compliant with distribution filesystem layout policies, if
projects must specify a \fBDESTINATION\fP, it is strongly recommended that they use
a path that begins with the appropriate relative \fI\%GNUInstallDirs\fP variable.
This allows package maintainers to control the install destination by setting
the appropriate cache variables.  The following example shows a static library
being installed to the default destination provided by
\fI\%GNUInstallDirs\fP, but with its headers installed to a project\-specific
subdirectory without using file sets:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(mylib STATIC ...)
set_target_properties(mylib PROPERTIES PUBLIC_HEADER mylib.h)
include(GNUInstallDirs)

        PUBLIC_HEADER
          DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}/myproj
)
.ft P

.UNINDENT

.sp
In addition to the \fI\%common options\fP listed above, each target can accept
the following additional arguments:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBNAMELINK_COMPONENT\fP
New in version 3.12.

.sp
On some platforms a versioned shared library has a symbolic link such
as:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
lib<name>.so \-> lib<name>.so.1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fBlib<name>.so.1\fP is the soname of the library and \fBlib<name>.so\fP
is a \(dqnamelink\(dq allowing linkers to find the library when given
\fB\-l<name>\fP\&. The \fBNAMELINK_COMPONENT\fP option is similar to the
\fBCOMPONENT\fP option, but it changes the installation component of a shared
library namelink if one is generated. If not specified, this defaults to the
value of \fBCOMPONENT\fP\&. It is an error to use this parameter outside of a
\fBLIBRARY\fP block.
.sp
Changed in version 3.27: This parameter is also usable for an \fBARCHIVE\fP block to manage
the linker import file created, on macOS, for shared libraries with
\fI\%ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP enabled.

.sp
See the \fI\%Example: Install Targets with Per\-Artifact Components\fP
for an example using \fBNAMELINK_COMPONENT\fP\&.
.sp
This option is typically used for package managers that have separate
runtime and development packages. For example, on Debian systems, the
library is expected to be in the runtime package, and the headers and
namelink are expected to be in the development package.
.sp
See the \fI\%VERSION\fP and \fI\%SOVERSION\fP target properties for
details on creating versioned shared libraries.
.TP
.B \fBNAMELINK_ONLY\fP
This option causes the installation of only the namelink when a library
target is installed. On platforms where versioned shared libraries do not
have namelinks or when a library is not versioned, the \fBNAMELINK_ONLY\fP
option installs nothing. It is an error to use this parameter outside of a
\fBLIBRARY\fP block.
.sp
Changed in version 3.27: This parameter is also usable for an \fBARCHIVE\fP block to manage
the linker import file created, on macOS, for shared libraries with
\fI\%ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP enabled.

.sp
When \fBNAMELINK_ONLY\fP is given, either \fBNAMELINK_COMPONENT\fP or
\fBCOMPONENT\fP may be used to specify the installation component of the
namelink, but \fBCOMPONENT\fP should generally be preferred.
.TP
.B \fBNAMELINK_SKIP\fP
Similar to \fBNAMELINK_ONLY\fP, but it has the opposite effect: it causes the
installation of library files other than the namelink when a library target
is installed. When neither \fBNAMELINK_ONLY\fP or \fBNAMELINK_SKIP\fP are given,
both portions are installed. On platforms where versioned shared libraries
do not have symlinks or when a library is not versioned, \fBNAMELINK_SKIP\fP
installs the library. It is an error to use this parameter outside of a
\fBLIBRARY\fP block.
.sp
Changed in version 3.27: This parameter is also usable for an \fBARCHIVE\fP block to manage
the linker import file created, on macOS, for shared libraries with
\fI\%ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP enabled.

.sp
If \fBNAMELINK_SKIP\fP is specified, \fBNAMELINK_COMPONENT\fP has no effect. It
is not recommended to use \fBNAMELINK_SKIP\fP in conjunction with
\fBNAMELINK_COMPONENT\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%install(TARGETS)\fP command can also accept the following
options at the top level:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBEXPORT\fP
This option associates the installed target files with an export called
\fB<export\-name>\fP\&.  It must appear before any target options.
To actually install the export file itself, call
\fI\%install(EXPORT)\fP, documented below.
See documentation of the \fI\%EXPORT_NAME\fP target property to change
the name of the exported target.
.sp
If \fBEXPORT\fP is used and the targets include \fBPUBLIC\fP or \fBINTERFACE\fP
file sets, all of them must be specified with \fBFILE_SET\fP arguments. All
\fBPUBLIC\fP or \fBINTERFACE\fP file sets associated with a target are included
in the export.
.TP
.B \fBINCLUDES DESTINATION\fP
This option specifies a list of directories which will be added to the
\fI\%INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP target property of the
\fB<targets>\fP when exported by the \fI\%install(EXPORT)\fP command.
If a relative path is specified, it is treated as relative to the
\fI\%$<INSTALL_PREFIX>\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBRUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET <set\-name>\fP
New in version 3.21.

.sp
This option causes all runtime dependencies of installed executable, shared
library, and module targets to be added to the specified runtime dependency
set. This set can then be installed with an
\fI\%install(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET)\fP command.
.sp
This keyword and the \fBRUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES\fP keyword are mutually
exclusive.
.TP
.B \fBRUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES <arg>...\fP
New in version 3.21.

.sp
This option causes all runtime dependencies of installed executable, shared
library, and module targets to be installed along with the targets
themselves. The \fBRUNTIME\fP, \fBLIBRARY\fP, \fBFRAMEWORK\fP, and generic
arguments are used to determine the properties (\fBDESTINATION\fP,
\fBCOMPONENT\fP, etc.) of the installation of these dependencies.
.sp
\fBRUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES\fP is semantically equivalent to the following pair
of calls:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

\fI\%Interface Libraries\fP may be listed among the targets to install.
They install no artifacts but will be included in an associated \fBEXPORT\fP\&.
If \fI\%Object Libraries\fP are listed but given no destination for their
object files, they will be exported as \fI\%Interface Libraries\fP\&.
This is sufficient to satisfy transitive usage requirements of other
targets that link to the object libraries in their implementation.
.sp
Installing a target with the \fI\%EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP target property
set to \fBTRUE\fP has undefined behavior.
.sp
New in version 3.3: An install destination given as a \fBDESTINATION\fP argument may

\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual for available expressions.

.sp
New in version 3.13: \fI\%install(TARGETS)\fP can install targets that were created in
other directories.  When using such cross\-directory install rules, running
\fBmake install\fP (or similar) from a subdirectory will not guarantee that
targets from other directories are up\-to\-date.  You can use
\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP or \fI\%add_dependencies()\fP

The \fBIMPORTED_RUNTIME_ARTIFACTS\fP form specifies rules for installing the
runtime artifacts of imported targets. Projects may do this if they want to
bundle outside executables or modules inside their installation. The
\fBLIBRARY\fP, \fBRUNTIME\fP, \fBFRAMEWORK\fP, and \fBBUNDLE\fP arguments have the
same semantics that they do in the \fI\%TARGETS\fP mode. Only the runtime artifacts
of imported targets are installed (except in the case of \fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP
libraries, \fI\%MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP executables, and \fI\%BUNDLE\fP
CFBundles.) For example, headers and import libraries associated with DLLs are
not installed. In the case of \fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP libraries,
\fI\%MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP executables, and \fI\%BUNDLE\fP CFBundles, the
entire directory is installed.
.sp
The \fBRUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET\fP option causes the runtime artifacts of the

The \fBFILES\fP form specifies rules for installing files for a project.
File names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the
current source directory.  Files installed by this form are by default
given permissions \fBOWNER_WRITE\fP, \fBOWNER_READ\fP, \fBGROUP_READ\fP, and
\fBWORLD_READ\fP if no \fBPERMISSIONS\fP argument is given.
.sp
The \fBPROGRAMS\fP form is identical to the \fBFILES\fP form except that the
default permissions for the installed file also include \fBOWNER_EXECUTE\fP,
\fBGROUP_EXECUTE\fP, and \fBWORLD_EXECUTE\fP\&.  This form is intended to install
programs that are not targets, such as shell scripts.  Use the \fBTARGETS\fP
form to install targets built within the project.
.sp
The list of \fBfiles...\fP given to \fBFILES\fP or \fBPROGRAMS\fP may use
\(dqgenerator expressions\(dq with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the
\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual for available expressions.
However, if any item begins in a generator expression it must evaluate
to a full path.
.sp
Either a \fBTYPE\fP or a \fBDESTINATION\fP must be provided, but not both.
A \fBTYPE\fP argument specifies the generic file type of the files being
installed.  A destination will then be set automatically by taking the
corresponding variable from \fI\%GNUInstallDirs\fP, or by using a
built\-in default if that variable is not defined.  See the table below for
the supported file types and their corresponding variables and built\-in
defaults.  Projects can provide a \fBDESTINATION\fP argument instead of a
file type if they wish to explicitly define the install destination.

Projects wishing to follow the common practice of installing headers into a
project\-specific subdirectory will need to provide a destination rather than
rely on the above. Using file sets for headers instead of \fBinstall(FILES)\fP
would be even better (see \fI\%target_sources(FILE_SET)\fP).
.sp
Note that some of the types\(aq built\-in defaults use the \fBDATAROOT\fP directory as
a prefix. The \fBDATAROOT\fP prefix is calculated similarly to the types, with
\fBCMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR\fP as the variable and \fBshare\fP as the built\-in
default. You cannot use \fBDATAROOT\fP as a \fBTYPE\fP parameter; please use
\fBDATA\fP instead.

To make packages compliant with distribution filesystem layout policies, if
projects must specify a \fBDESTINATION\fP, it is strongly recommended that they use
a path that begins with the appropriate relative \fI\%GNUInstallDirs\fP variable.

The \fBDIRECTORY\fP form installs contents of one or more directories to a
given destination.  The directory structure is copied verbatim to the
destination.  The last component of each directory name is appended to
the destination directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid
this because it leaves the last component empty.  Directory names
given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current
source directory.  If no input directory names are given the
destination directory will be created but nothing will be installed
into it.  The \fBFILE_PERMISSIONS\fP and \fBDIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS\fP options
specify permissions given to files and directories in the destination.
If \fBUSE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS\fP is specified and \fBFILE_PERMISSIONS\fP is not,
file permissions will be copied from the source directory structure.
If no permissions are specified files will be given the default

\fBPROGRAMS\fP form of the command.
.sp
New in version 3.1: The \fBMESSAGE_NEVER\fP option disables file installation status output.

.sp
Installation of directories may be controlled with fine granularity
using the \fBPATTERN\fP or \fBREGEX\fP options.  These \(dqmatch\(dq options specify a
globbing pattern or regular expression to match directories or files
encountered within input directories.  They may be used to apply
certain options (see below) to a subset of the files and directories
encountered.  The full path to each input file or directory (with
forward slashes) is matched against the expression.  A \fBPATTERN\fP will
match only complete file names: the portion of the full path matching
the pattern must occur at the end of the file name and be preceded by
a slash.  A \fBREGEX\fP will match any portion of the full path but it may
use \fB/\fP and \fB$\fP to simulate the \fBPATTERN\fP behavior.  By default all
files and directories are installed whether or not they are matched.
The \fBFILES_MATCHING\fP option may be given before the first match option
to disable installation of files (but not directories) not matched by
any expression.  For example, the code
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

The \fBEXPORT\fP form generates and installs a CMake file containing code to
import targets from the installation tree into another project.
Target installations are associated with the export \fB<export\-name>\fP
using the \fBEXPORT\fP option of the \fI\%install(TARGETS)\fP signature
documented above.  The \fBNAMESPACE\fP option will prepend \fB<namespace>\fP to
the target names as they are written to the import file.  By default
the generated file will be called \fB<export\-name>.cmake\fP but the \fBFILE\fP
option may be used to specify a different name.  The value given to
the \fBFILE\fP option must be a file name with the \fB\&.cmake\fP extension.
If a \fBCONFIGURATIONS\fP option is given then the file will only be installed
when one of the named configurations is installed.  Additionally, the
generated import file will reference only the matching target
configurations.  See the \fI\%CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>\fP
variable to map configurations of dependent projects to the installed
configurations.  The \fBEXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP keyword, if
present, causes the contents of the properties matching
\fB(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?\fP to be exported, when
policy \fI\%CMP0022\fP is \fBNEW\fP\&.

When a \fBCOMPONENT\fP option is given, the listed \fB<component>\fP implicitly
depends on all components mentioned in the export set. The exported
\fB<name>.cmake\fP file will require each of the exported components to be
present in order for dependent projects to build properly. For example, a
project may define components \fBRuntime\fP and \fBDevelopment\fP, with shared
libraries going into the \fBRuntime\fP component and static libraries and
headers going into the \fBDevelopment\fP component. The export set would also
typically be part of the \fBDevelopment\fP component, but it would export
targets from both the \fBRuntime\fP and \fBDevelopment\fP components. Therefore,
the \fBRuntime\fP component would need to be installed if the \fBDevelopment\fP
component was installed, but not vice versa. If the \fBDevelopment\fP component
was installed without the \fBRuntime\fP component, dependent projects that try
to link against it would have build errors. Package managers, such as APT and
RPM, typically handle this by listing the \fBRuntime\fP component as a dependency
of the \fBDevelopment\fP component in the package metadata, ensuring that the
library is always installed if the headers and CMake export file are present.
.sp
New in version 3.7: In addition to cmake language files, the \fBEXPORT_ANDROID_MK\fP mode may be
used to specify an export to the android ndk build system.  This mode
accepts the same options as the normal export mode.  The Android
NDK supports the use of prebuilt libraries, both static and shared. This
allows cmake to build the libraries of a project and make them available
to an ndk build system complete with transitive dependencies, include flags
and defines required to use the libraries.

\fI\%EXPORT_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME\fP property set, and such package
dependency was not disabled by passing \fBENABLED OFF\fP to
\fI\%export(SETUP)\fP, then a \fI\%find_dependency()\fP call is

macOS frameworks are installed in the \fBFRAMEWORK\fP destination and component.
Targets built within the build tree will never be installed as runtime
dependencies, nor will their own dependencies, unless the targets themselves
are installed with \fI\%install(TARGETS)\fP\&.
.sp
The generated install script calls \fI\%file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)\fP

executable files are passed as the \fBEXECUTABLES\fP argument, the build\-tree
shared libraries as the \fBLIBRARIES\fP argument, and the build\-tree modules as
the \fBMODULES\fP argument. On macOS, if one of the executables is a
\fI\%MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP, that executable is passed as the
\fBBUNDLE_EXECUTABLE\fP argument. At most one such bundle executable may be in
the runtime dependency set on macOS. The \fI\%MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP property
has no effect on other platforms. Note that
\fI\%file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)\fP only supports collecting the runtime
dependencies for Windows, Linux and macOS platforms, so
\fBinstall(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET)\fP has the same limitation.

.SS Code Injection
.sp
A number of variables can be defined by the user to specify files to include
at different points during the execution of the \fBproject()\fP command.
The following outlines the steps performed during a \fBproject()\fP call:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
New in version 3.15: For every \fBproject()\fP call regardless of the project
name, include the file(s) and module(s) named by
\fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE\fP, if set.

.IP \(bu 2
New in version 3.17: If the \fBproject()\fP command specifies \fB<PROJECT\-NAME>\fP as its project
name, include the file(s) and module(s) named by
\fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_<PROJECT\-NAME>_INCLUDE_BEFORE\fP, if set.

.IP \(bu 2
Set the various project\-specific variables detailed in the \fI\%Synopsis\fP
and \fI\%Options\fP sections above.
.IP \(bu 2
For the very first \fBproject()\fP call only:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
If \fI\%CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\fP is set, read it at least once.
It may be read multiple times and it may also be read again when
enabling languages later (see below).
.IP \(bu 2
Set the variables describing the host and target platforms.
Language\-specific variables might or might not be set at this point.
On the first run, the only language\-specific variables that might be
defined are those a toolchain file may have set. On subsequent runs,
language\-specific variables cached from a previous run may be set.
.IP \(bu 2
New in version 3.24: Include each file listed in \fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES\fP,
if set. The variable is ignored by CMake thereafter.

.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Enable any languages specified in the call, or the default languages if
none were provided. The toolchain file may be re\-read when enabling a
language for the first time.
.IP \(bu 2
New in version 3.15: For every \fBproject()\fP call regardless of the project
name, include the file(s) and module(s) named by
\fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE\fP, if set.

.IP \(bu 2
If the \fBproject()\fP command specifies \fB<PROJECT\-NAME>\fP as its project
name, include the file(s) and module(s) named by
\fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_<PROJECT\-NAME>_INCLUDE\fP, if set.
.UNINDENT
.SS Usage
.sp
The top\-level \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file for a project must contain a
literal, direct call to the \fBproject()\fP command; loading one
through the \fI\%include()\fP command is not sufficient.  If no such
call exists, CMake will issue a warning and pretend there is a
\fBproject(Project)\fP at the top to enable the default languages
(\fBC\fP and \fBCXX\fP).
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Call the \fBproject()\fP command near the top of the top\-level
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP, but \fIafter\fP calling \fI\%cmake_minimum_required()\fP\&.
It is important to establish version and policy settings before invoking
other commands whose behavior they may affect and for this reason the
\fBproject()\fP command will issue a warning if this order is not kept.
See also policy \fI\%CMP0000\fP\&.

.SS Option De\-duplication
.sp
The final set of options used for a target is constructed by
accumulating options from the current target and the usage requirements of
its dependencies.  The set of options is de\-duplicated to avoid repetition.
.sp
New in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the de\-duplication step can break
up option groups.  For example, \fB\-option A \-option B\fP becomes
\fB\-option A B\fP\&.  One may specify a group of options using shell\-like
quoting along with a \fBSHELL:\fP prefix.  The \fBSHELL:\fP prefix is dropped,
and the rest of the option string is parsed using the
\fI\%separate_arguments()\fP \fBUNIX_COMMAND\fP mode. For example,
\fB\(dqSHELL:\-option A\(dq \(dqSHELL:\-option B\(dq\fP becomes \fB\-option A \-option B\fP\&.

The \fBINTERFACE\fP, \fBPUBLIC\fP and \fBPRIVATE\fP keywords are required to specify

\fBPRIVATE\fP and \fBPUBLIC\fP items will populate the \fI\%INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP

.sp
Repeated calls for the same \fB<target>\fP append items in the order called.
.sp
If \fBSYSTEM\fP is specified, the compiler will be told the directories
are meant as system include directories on some platforms.  This may
have effects such as suppressing warnings or skipping the contained
headers in dependency calculations (see compiler documentation).
Additionally, system include directories are searched after normal
include directories regardless of the order specified.
.sp
If \fBSYSTEM\fP is used together with \fBPUBLIC\fP or \fBINTERFACE\fP, the
\fI\%INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP target property will be
populated with the specified directories.
.sp
Arguments to \fBtarget_include_directories\fP may use generator expressions
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&. See the \fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fI\%cmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.sp
Specified include directories may be absolute paths or relative paths.
A relative path will be interpreted as relative to the current source
directory (i.e. \fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR\fP) and converted to an
absolute path before storing it in the associated target property.
If the path starts with a generator expression, it will always be assumed
to be an absolute path (with one exception noted below) and will be used
unmodified.
.sp
Include directories usage requirements commonly differ between the build\-tree
and the install\-tree.  The \fI\%BUILD_INTERFACE\fP and
\fI\%INSTALL_INTERFACE\fP generator expressions can be used to describe
separate usage requirements based on the usage location.  Relative paths
are allowed within the \fI\%INSTALL_INTERFACE\fP expression and are
interpreted as relative to the installation prefix.  Relative paths should not
be used in \fI\%BUILD_INTERFACE\fP expressions because they will not be
converted to absolute.  For example:

\fBas found on the machine the package was made on\fP\&.
.sp
The \fI\%INSTALL_INTERFACE\fP of the \fI\%INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP is only
suitable for specifying the required include directories for headers
provided with the target itself, not those provided by the transitive
dependencies listed in its \fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP target

their own header locations in \fI\%INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\&.

\fI\%ALIAS target\fP\&.  If policy \fI\%CMP0079\fP is not
set to \fBNEW\fP then the target must have been created in the current
directory.  Repeated calls for the same \fB<target>\fP append items in
the order called.
.sp
New in version 3.13: The \fB<target>\fP doesn\(aqt have to be defined in the same directory as the
\fBtarget_link_libraries\fP call.

.sp
Each \fB<item>\fP may be:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBA library target name\fP: The generated link line will have the
full path to the linkable library file associated with the target.
The buildsystem will have a dependency to re\-link \fB<target>\fP if
the library file changes.
.sp
The named target must be created by \fI\%add_library()\fP within
the project or as an \fI\%IMPORTED library\fP\&.
If it is created within the project an ordering dependency will
automatically be added in the build system to make sure the named
library target is up\-to\-date before the \fB<target>\fP links.
.sp
If an imported library has the \fI\%IMPORTED_NO_SONAME\fP
target property set, CMake may ask the linker to search for
the library instead of using the full path
(e.g. \fB/usr/lib/libfoo.so\fP becomes \fB\-lfoo\fP).
.sp
The full path to the target\(aqs artifact will be quoted/escaped for
the shell automatically.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBA full path to a library file\fP: The generated link line will
normally preserve the full path to the file. The buildsystem will
have a dependency to re\-link \fB<target>\fP if the library file changes.
.sp
There are some cases where CMake may ask the linker to search for
the library (e.g. \fB/usr/lib/libfoo.so\fP becomes \fB\-lfoo\fP), such
as when a shared library is detected to have no \fBSONAME\fP field.
See policy \fI\%CMP0060\fP for discussion of another case.
.sp
If the library file is in a macOS framework, the \fBHeaders\fP directory
of the framework will also be processed as a
\fI\%usage requirement\fP\&.  This has the same
effect as passing the framework directory as an include directory.
.sp
New in version 3.28: The library file may point to a \fB\&.xcframework\fP folder on Apple platforms.
If it does, the target will get the selected library\(aqs \fBHeaders\fP
directory as a usage requirement.

.sp
New in version 3.8: On \fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP for VS 2010 and above, library files
ending in \fB\&.targets\fP will be treated as MSBuild targets files and
imported into generated project files.  This is not supported by other
generators.

.sp
The full path to the library file will be quoted/escaped for
the shell automatically.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBA plain library name\fP: The generated link line will ask the linker
to search for the library (e.g. \fBfoo\fP becomes \fB\-lfoo\fP or \fBfoo.lib\fP).
.sp
The library name/flag is treated as a command\-line string fragment and
will be used with no extra quoting or escaping.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBA link flag\fP: Item names starting with \fB\-\fP, but not \fB\-l\fP or
\fB\-framework\fP, are treated as linker flags.  Note that such flags will
be treated like any other library link item for purposes of transitive
dependencies, so they are generally safe to specify only as private link
items that will not propagate to dependents.
.sp
Link flags specified here are inserted into the link command in the same
place as the link libraries. This might not be correct, depending on
the linker. Use the \fI\%LINK_OPTIONS\fP target property or
\fI\%target_link_options()\fP command to add link
flags explicitly. The flags will then be placed at the toolchain\-defined
flag position in the link command.
.sp
New in version 3.13: \fI\%LINK_OPTIONS\fP target property and \fI\%target_link_options()\fP
command.  For earlier versions of CMake, use \fI\%LINK_FLAGS\fP
property instead.

.sp
The link flag is treated as a command\-line string fragment and
will be used with no extra quoting or escaping.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBA generator expression\fP: A \fB$<...>\fP \fI\%generator expression\fP may evaluate to any of the above
items or to a \fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP of them.
If the \fB\&...\fP contains any \fB;\fP characters, e.g. after evaluation
of a \fB${list}\fP variable, be sure to use an explicitly quoted
argument \fB\(dq$<...>\(dq\fP so that this command receives it as a
single \fB<item>\fP\&.
.sp
Additionally, a generator expression may be used as a fragment of
any of the above items, e.g. \fBfoo$<1:_d>\fP\&.
.sp
Note that generator expressions will not be used in OLD handling of
policy \fI\%CMP0003\fP or policy \fI\%CMP0004\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBdebug\fP, \fBoptimized\fP, or \fBgeneral\fP keyword immediately followed
by another \fB<item>\fP\&.  The item following such a keyword will be used
only for the corresponding build configuration.  The \fBdebug\fP keyword
corresponds to the \fBDebug\fP configuration (or to configurations named
in the \fI\%DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS\fP global property if it is set).
The \fBoptimized\fP keyword corresponds to all other configurations.  The
\fBgeneral\fP keyword corresponds to all configurations, and is purely
optional.  Higher granularity may be achieved for per\-configuration
rules by creating and linking to
\fI\%IMPORTED library targets\fP\&.
These keywords are interpreted immediately by this command and therefore
have no special meaning when produced by a generator expression.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Items containing \fB::\fP, such as \fBFoo::Bar\fP, are assumed to be
\fI\%IMPORTED\fP or \fI\%ALIAS\fP library
target names and will cause an error if no such target exists.

This also works transitively through a static library.  Since a static
library does not link, it does not consume the object files from
object libraries referenced this way.  Instead, the object files
become transitive link dependencies of the static library.
Continuing the above example, the code
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(static3 STATIC static3.c)
target_link_libraries(static3 PRIVATE iface_obj3)

add_executable(use_static3 use_static3.c)
target_link_libraries(use_static3 PRIVATE static3)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
compiles \fBstatic3.c\fP with \fB\-DOBJ3\fP and creates \fBlibstatic3.a\fP
using only its own object file.  \fBuse_static3.c\fP is compiled \fIwithout\fP
\fB\-DOBJ3\fP because the usage requirement is not transitive through
the private dependency of \fBstatic3\fP\&.  However, the link dependencies
of \fBstatic3\fP are propagated, including the \fBiface_obj3\fP reference
to \fB$<TARGET_OBJECTS:obj3>\fP\&.  The \fBuse_static3\fP executable is
created with object files from \fBuse_static3.c\fP and \fBobj3.c\fP, and
linked to library \fBlibstatic3.a\fP\&.
.sp
When using this approach, it is the project\(aqs responsibility to avoid
linking multiple dependent binaries to \fBiface_obj3\fP, because they will
all get the \fBobj3\fP object files on their link lines.

.SS Cyclic Dependencies of Static Libraries
.sp
The library dependency graph is normally acyclic (a DAG), but in the case
of mutually\-dependent \fBSTATIC\fP libraries CMake allows the graph to
contain cycles (strongly connected components).  When another target links
to one of the libraries, CMake repeats the entire connected component.
For example, the code
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(A STATIC a.c)
add_library(B STATIC b.c)
target_link_libraries(A B)
target_link_libraries(B A)
add_executable(main main.c)
target_link_libraries(main A)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
links \fBmain\fP to \fBA B A B\fP\&.  While one repetition is usually
sufficient, pathological object file and symbol arrangements can require
more.  One may handle such cases by using the
\fI\%LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY\fP target property or by manually
repeating the component in the last \fBtarget_link_libraries\fP call.
However, if two archives are really so interdependent they should probably
be combined into a single archive, perhaps by using \fI\%Object Libraries\fP\&.
.SS Creating Relocatable Packages
.sp
Note that it is not advisable to populate the
\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard\-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies \fBas found on the machine the package was made on\fP\&.
.sp
See the \fI\%Creating Relocatable Packages\fP section of the
\fI\%cmake\-packages(7)\fP manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.

\fI\%$<DEVICE_LINK:...>\fP generator expression will be used
only for the device link step. Options wrapped with \fI\%$<HOST_LINK:...>\fP
generator expression will be used only for the host link step.

.SS Option De\-duplication
.sp
The final set of options used for a target is constructed by
accumulating options from the current target and the usage requirements of
its dependencies.  The set of options is de\-duplicated to avoid repetition.
.sp
New in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the de\-duplication step can break
up option groups.  For example, \fB\-option A \-option B\fP becomes
\fB\-option A B\fP\&.  One may specify a group of options using shell\-like
quoting along with a \fBSHELL:\fP prefix.  The \fBSHELL:\fP prefix is dropped,
and the rest of the option string is parsed using the
\fI\%separate_arguments()\fP \fBUNIX_COMMAND\fP mode. For example,
\fB\(dqSHELL:\-option A\(dq \(dqSHELL:\-option B\(dq\fP becomes \fB\-option A \-option B\fP\&.

.SS Handling Compiler Driver Differences
.sp
To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix and \fB,\fP separator can be used to specify, in a portable
way, options to pass to the linker tool. \fBLINKER:\fP is replaced by the
appropriate driver option and \fB,\fP by the appropriate driver separator.
The driver prefix and driver separator are given by the values of the
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG\fP and
\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP\fP variables.
.sp
For example, \fB\(dqLINKER:\-z,defs\(dq\fP becomes \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fP for
\fBClang\fP and \fB\-Wl,\-z,defs\fP for \fBGNU GCC\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix can be specified as part of a \fBSHELL:\fP prefix
expression.
.sp
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of
arguments using the \fBSHELL:\fP prefix and space as separator. The previous
example then becomes \fB\(dqLINKER:SHELL:\-z defs\(dq\fP\&.

.SS target_precompile_headers
.sp
New in version 3.16.

.sp
Add a list of header files to precompile.
.sp
Precompiling header files can speed up compilation by creating a partially

compilations rather than repeatedly parsing the original headers.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The command adds header files to the \fI\%PRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP and/or
\fI\%INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP target properties of \fB<target>\fP\&.
The named \fB<target>\fP must have been created by a command such as
\fI\%add_executable()\fP or \fI\%add_library()\fP and must not be an
\fI\%ALIAS target\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBINTERFACE\fP, \fBPUBLIC\fP and \fBPRIVATE\fP keywords are required to
specify the \fI\%scope\fP of the following arguments.
\fBPRIVATE\fP and \fBPUBLIC\fP items will populate the \fI\%PRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP
property of \fB<target>\fP\&.  \fBPUBLIC\fP and \fBINTERFACE\fP items will populate the
\fI\%INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP property of \fB<target>\fP
(\fI\%IMPORTED targets\fP only support \fBINTERFACE\fP items).
Repeated calls for the same \fB<target>\fP will append items in the order called.
.sp
Projects should generally avoid using \fBPUBLIC\fP or \fBINTERFACE\fP for targets
that will be \fI\%exported\fP, or they should at least use
the \fI\%$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>\fP generator expression to prevent precompile
headers from appearing in an installed exported target.  Consumers of a target
should typically be in control of what precompile headers they use, not have
precompile headers forced on them by the targets being consumed (since
precompile headers are not typically usage requirements).  A notable exception
to this is where an \fI\%interface library\fP is created
to define a commonly used set of precompile headers in one place and then other
targets link to that interface library privately.  In this case, the interface
library exists specifically to propagate the precompile headers to its
consumers and the consumer is effectively still in control, since it decides
whether to link to the interface library or not.
.sp
The list of header files is used to generate a header file named
\fBcmake_pch.h|xx\fP which is used to generate the precompiled header file
(\fB\&.pch\fP, \fB\&.gch\fP, \fB\&.pchi\fP) artifact.  The \fBcmake_pch.h|xx\fP header
file will be force included (\fB\-include\fP for GCC, \fB/FI\fP for MSVC) to
all source files, so sources do not need to have \fB#include \(dqpch.h\(dq\fP\&.
.sp
Header file names specified with angle brackets (e.g. \fB<unordered_map>\fP) or
explicit double quotes (escaped for the \fI\%cmake\-language(7)\fP,
e.g. \fB[[\(dqother_header.h\(dq]]\fP) will be treated as is, and include directories
must be available for the compiler to find them.  Other header file names
(e.g. \fBproject_header.h\fP) are interpreted as being relative to the current
source directory (e.g. \fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR\fP) and will be
included by absolute path.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C

Arguments to \fBtarget_precompile_headers\fP may use generator expressions
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&. See the \fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  The \fI\%$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:...>\fP generator
expression is particularly useful for specifying a language\-specific header
to precompile for only one language (e.g. \fBCXX\fP and not \fBC\fP).  In this
case, header file names that are not explicitly in double quotes or angle
brackets must be specified by absolute path.  Also, when specifying angle
brackets inside a generator expression, be sure to encode the closing
\fB>\fP as \fI\%$<ANGLE\-R>\fP\&.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0

For debugging, \fI\%\-\-debug\-trycompile\fP can be

\fBtry_compile\fP operations, if given the same \fB<bindir>\fP, will reuse this

call at a time.  Use of the newer signature is recommended to simplify
debugging of multiple \fBtry_compile\fP operations.
.SS Options
.sp
The options for the above signatures are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...\fP
Specify flags of the form \fI\%\-DVAR:TYPE=VALUE\fP to be passed
to the \fI\%cmake(1)\fP command\-line used to drive the test build.
The above example shows how values for variables
\fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP, \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP, \fBLINK_DIRECTORIES\fP,
\fBLINK_LIBRARIES\fP, and \fBLINK_OPTIONS\fP are used. Compiler options
can be passed in like \fICMAKE_FLAGS \-DCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS=\-Werror\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS <defs>...\fP
Specify \fB\-Ddefinition\fP arguments to pass to \fI\%add_definitions()\fP
in the generated test project.
.TP
.B \fBCOPY_FILE <fileName>\fP
Copy the built executable or static library to the given \fB<fileName>\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBCOPY_FILE_ERROR <var>\fP
Use after \fBCOPY_FILE\fP to capture into variable \fB<var>\fP any error
message encountered while trying to copy the file.
.TP
.B \fBLINK_LIBRARIES <libs>...\fP
Specify libraries to be linked in the generated project.
The list of libraries may refer to system libraries and to
\fI\%Imported Targets\fP from the calling project.
.sp
If this option is specified, any \fB\-DLINK_LIBRARIES=...\fP value
given to the \fBCMAKE_FLAGS\fP option will be ignored.
.sp
New in version 3.29: Alias targets to imported libraries are also supported.

.TP
.B \fBLINK_OPTIONS <options>...\fP
New in version 3.14.

.sp
Specify link step options to pass to \fI\%target_link_options()\fP or to
set the \fI\%STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS\fP target property in the generated
project, depending on the \fI\%CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fBLINKER_LANGUAGE <lang>\fP
New in version 3.29.

.sp
Specify the \fI\%LINKER_LANGUAGE\fP target property of the generated
project.  When using multiple source files with different languages, set
this to the language of the source file containing the program entry point,
e.g., \fBmain\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBLOG_DESCRIPTION <text>\fP
New in version 3.26.

.sp
Specify a non\-empty text description of the purpose of the check.
This is recorded in the \fI\%cmake\-configure\-log(7)\fP entry.
.TP
.B \fBNO_CACHE\fP
New in version 3.25.

.sp
The result will be stored in a normal variable rather than a cache entry.
.sp
The result variable is normally cached so that a simple pattern can be used
to avoid repeating the test on subsequent executions of CMake:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.sp
If the guard variable and result variable are not the same (for example, if
the test is part of a larger inspection), \fBNO_CACHE\fP may be useful to avoid
leaking the intermediate result variable into the cache.
.TP
.B \fBNO_LOG\fP
New in version 3.26.

.sp
Do not record a \fI\%cmake\-configure\-log(7)\fP entry for this call.
.TP
.B \fBOUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>\fP
Store the output from the build process in the given variable.
.TP
.B \fBSOURCE_FROM_CONTENT <name> <content>\fP
New in version 3.25.

.sp
Write \fB<content>\fP to a file named \fB<name>\fP in the operation directory.
This can be used to bypass the need to separately write a source file when
the contents of the file are dynamically specified. The specified \fB<name>\fP
is not allowed to contain path components.
.sp
\fBSOURCE_FROM_CONTENT\fP may be specified multiple times.
.TP
.B \fBSOURCE_FROM_FILE <name> <path>\fP
New in version 3.25.

.sp
Copy \fB<path>\fP to a file named \fB<name>\fP in the operation directory. This
can be used to consolidate files into the operation directory, which may be
useful if a source which already exists (i.e. as a stand\-alone file in a
project\(aqs source repository) needs to refer to other file(s) created by
\fBSOURCE_FROM_*\fP\&. (Otherwise, \fBSOURCES\fP is usually more convenient.) The
specified \fB<name>\fP is not allowed to contain path components.
.TP
.B \fBSOURCE_FROM_VAR <name> <var>\fP
New in version 3.25.

.sp
Write the contents of \fB<var>\fP to a file named \fB<name>\fP in the operation
directory. This is the same as \fBSOURCE_FROM_CONTENT\fP, but takes the
contents from the specified CMake variable, rather than directly, which may
be useful when passing arguments through a function which wraps
\fBtry_compile\fP\&. The specified \fB<name>\fP is not allowed to contain path
components.
.sp
\fBSOURCE_FROM_VAR\fP may be specified multiple times.
.TP
.B \fBSOURCES_TYPE <type>\fP
New in version 3.28.

.sp
Sources may be classified using the \fBSOURCES_TYPE\fP argument. Once
specified, all subsequent sources specified will be treated as that type
until another \fBSOURCES_TYPE\fP is given. Available types are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBNORMAL\fP
Sources are not added to any \fBFILE_SET\fP in the generated project.

.SS Behavior when Cross Compiling
.sp
New in version 3.3: Use \fBCMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR\fP when running cross\-compiled binaries.

.sp
When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the first step
usually cannot be run on the build host.  The \fBtry_run\fP command checks
the \fI\%CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING\fP variable to detect whether CMake is in
cross\-compiling mode.  If that is the case, it will still try to compile
the executable, but it will not try to run the executable unless the
\fI\%CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR\fP variable is set.  Instead it
will create cache variables which must be filled by the user or by
presetting them in some CMake script file to the values the executable
would have produced if it had been run on its actual target platform.
These cache entries are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB<runResultVar>\fP
Exit code if the executable were to be run on the target platform.
.TP
.B \fB<runResultVar>__TRYRUN_OUTPUT\fP
Output from stdout and stderr if the executable were to be run on
the target platform.  This is created only if the
\fBRUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE\fP or \fBOUTPUT_VARIABLE\fP option was used.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In order to make cross compiling your project easier, use \fBtry_run\fP
only if really required.  If you use \fBtry_run\fP, use the
\fBRUN_OUTPUT_STDOUT_VARIABLE\fP, \fBRUN_OUTPUT_STDERR_VARIABLE\fP,
\fBRUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE\fP or \fBOUTPUT_VARIABLE\fP options only if really
required.  Using them will require that when cross\-compiling, the cache
variables will have to be set manually to the output of the executable.
You can also \(dqguard\(dq the calls to \fBtry_run\fP with an \fI\%if()\fP
block checking the \fI\%CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING\fP variable and
provide an easy\-to\-preset alternative for this case.

The parameters are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB<model>\fP
Set the dashboard model. Must be one of \fBExperimental\fP, \fBContinuous\fP, or
\fBNightly\fP\&. This parameter is required unless \fBAPPEND\fP is specified.
.TP
.B \fB<source>\fP
Set the source directory. If not specified, the value of
\fI\%CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY\fP is used instead.
.TP
.B \fB<binary>\fP
Set the binary directory. If not specified, the value of
\fI\%CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY\fP is used instead.
.TP
.B \fBGROUP <group>\fP
If \fBGROUP\fP is used, the submissions will go to the specified group on the
CDash server. If no \fBGROUP\fP is specified, the name of the model is used by
default.
.sp
Changed in version 3.16: This replaces the deprecated option \fBTRACK\fP\&. Despite the name
change its behavior is unchanged.

.TP
.B \fBAPPEND\fP
If \fBAPPEND\fP is used, the existing \fBTAG\fP is used rather than creating a new
one based on the current time stamp. If you use \fBAPPEND\fP, you can omit the
\fB<model>\fP and \fBGROUP <group>\fP parameters, because they will be read from
the generated \fBTAG\fP file. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

When the second script runs \fBctest_start(APPEND)\fP, it will read the
\fBExperimental\fP model and \fBGroupExperimental\fP group from the \fBTAG\fP file
generated by the first \fBctest_start()\fP command. Please note that if you
call \fBctest_start(APPEND)\fP and specify a different model or group than
in the first \fBctest_start()\fP command, a warning will be issued, and the
new model and group will be used.

otherwise would have printed to the console.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The parameters for \fBctest_start()\fP can be issued in any order, with the
exception that \fB<model>\fP, \fB<source>\fP, and \fB<binary>\fP have to appear
in that order with respect to each other. The following are all valid and
equivalent:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

ctest_start(Experimental path/to/source path/to/binary GROUP SomeGroup QUIET APPEND)

project files for all the examples at the same time, but you would not
want them to show up in the top level project or be built each time
make is run from the top.
.SS use_mangled_mesa
.sp
Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy \fI\%CMP0030\fP\&.
.sp
Copy mesa headers for use in combination with system GL.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The path to mesa includes, should contain \fBgl_mangle.h\fP\&.  The mesa
headers are copied to the specified output directory.  This allows
mangled mesa headers to override other GL headers by being added to
the include directory path earlier.
.SS utility_source
.sp
Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy \fI\%CMP0034\fP\&.
.sp
Specify the source tree of a third\-party utility.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
               path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When a third\-party utility\(aqs source is included in the distribution,
this command specifies its location and name.  The cache entry will
not be set unless the \fBpath_to_source\fP and all listed files exist.  It
is assumed that the source tree of the utility will have been built
before it is needed.
.sp
When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a \fButility_source()\fP
command is executed, because in many cases it is used to build an
executable which is executed later on.  This doesn\(aqt work when cross
compiling, since the executable can run only on their target platform.
So in this case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it
points to an executable which is runnable on the build host.
.SS variable_requires
.sp
Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy \fI\%CMP0035\fP\&.
.sp
Use the \fI\%if()\fP command instead.
.sp
Assert satisfaction of an option\(aqs required variables.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
                  REQUIRED_VARIABLE1
                  REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first argument (\fBTEST_VARIABLE\fP) is the name of the variable to be
tested, if that variable is false nothing else is done.  If
\fBTEST_VARIABLE\fP is true, then the next argument (\fBRESULT_VARIABLE\fP)
is a variable that is set to true if all the required variables are set.
The rest of the arguments are variables that must be true or not set
to \fBNOTFOUND\fP to avoid an error.  If any are not true, an error is
reported.
.SS write_file
.sp
Deprecated since version 3.0: Use the \fI\%file(WRITE)\fP command instead.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
write_file(filename \(dqmessage to write\(dq... [APPEND])
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are
messages to write.  If the argument \fBAPPEND\fP is specified, then the
message will be appended.
.sp
NOTE 1: \fI\%file(WRITE)\fP  and \fI\%file(APPEND)\fP  do exactly
the same as this one but add some more functionality.
.sp
NOTE 2: When using \fBwrite_file\fP the produced file cannot be used as an
input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it will lead
to an infinite loop.  Use \fI\%configure_file()\fP if you want to
generate input files to CMake.
