.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBcmake\-gui\fP executable is the CMake GUI.  Project configuration
settings may be specified interactively.  Brief instructions are
provided at the bottom of the window when the program is running.
.sp
CMake is a cross\-platform build system generator.  Projects specify
their build process with platform\-independent CMake listfiles included
in each directory of a source tree with the name \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP\&.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a
native tool on their platform.
