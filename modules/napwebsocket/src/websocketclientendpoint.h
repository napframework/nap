	 * Manages a list of client-server connections and acts as the main portal for the client to the server.

	 * The endpoint is a device that can be started and stopped. 
	 *
	 * When stopped all active client-server connections are closed. This occurs when file changes are detected
	 * and the content of the application is hot-reloaded. Typically an application
	 * has only one endpoint. Multiple clients can reference the same endpoint.
	 * Every connection update and message is forwarded to the client from a background thread.
	 * To receive connection updates and messages a client must be dervied from nap::IWebSocketClient.
	 *
	 * Note that depending on your operating system you might have to run the application as administrator
	 * to open a web-socket.
