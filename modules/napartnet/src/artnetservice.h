	/**
	 * Service for sending and receiving data over Artnet. Data is natively sent using bytes values, but the service provides
	 * a convenience function to send data using normalized float values. When calling one of the send functions, the 
	 * data is not sent directly, this is deferred to the update() call, where the service can control the frequence of 
	 * sending data and where it can make sure that data is resent when needed. Because of this, updating universes 
	 * partially and incrementally using multiple send calls does not impact functionality or performance of the system.
	 *
	 * To send data, create an ArtNetController and specify the subnet and universe for the controller. Then call send on it,
	 * this will redirect the send call to this service.
	 *
	 * To receive data, first create an ArtNetReceiver and specify the port to listen on for receiving ArtDmx packets.
	 * Then add an ArtNetInputComponent and specify whether to filter on ArtDmx packets by Net, SubNet and Universe or
	 * to receive all packets. Connect to the input component's packetReceived slot for handling the incoming events.
	 *
	 * Note: in the current sending implementation, only subnet and universe can be addressed. A correct implementation should include
	 * the full 16 bits and be able to address net(7 bits) - subnet(4 bits) - universe (4 bits). As we are using a library
	 * that doesn't support this correctly, we cannot address multiple nets. Now we are using 8 bits for the address, this should
	 * change as soon as we have more control over the implementation.
