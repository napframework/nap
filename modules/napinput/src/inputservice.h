	 * Stores and processes input events.
	 * Currently supports two types of input events: ControllerEvent and WindowInputEvent.
	 * Window input events are generated from a window and contain mouse, keyboard and touch events.
	 * Controller events are generated from an external piece of hardware such as a game controller or joystick and are not related to a window
	 * Separate functions are available to forward stored input events to parts of the scene / a set of entities.
	 * It's important to call process..() at least once every frame! 
	 * Dangling events, ie: events that are not processed, are cleared automatically each frame.
