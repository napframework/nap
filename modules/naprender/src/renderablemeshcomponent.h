	 * Represents a renderable mesh that can be used as a component in an entity hierarchy.

	 * forms a 'RenderableMesh'. It is validated that a mesh-material combination form a legal combination: vertex attributes
	 * in shader and mesh should match. Otherwise, the RenderableMesh is invalid. The RenderableMesh is an object that is created
	 * internally based on the mesh and the material that are set in the RenderableMeshComponent.
	 * It is, however, also possible to switch the mesh and/or material from the RenderableMeshComponent to some other mesh and/or 
	 * material. To do so, other components should create their own RenderableMesh by calling createRenderableMesh, and pass the returned
	 * object to setMesh. The object calling createRenderableMesh should own any custom mesh and/or material and it should validate in it's
	 * init() that the creation of the renderable mesh succeeded.
