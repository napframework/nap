	 * Global render state object. Users can freely change values in this object.

	 * Purpose of this object is to:
	 * 1) Provide an OpenGL independent way of setting render state
	 * 2) Provide a state object that can be duplicated for multiple GL contexts
	 * 3) Minimize openGL state changes
	 *
	 * RenderService will maintain a global render state, as well as render states per GL context.
	 * Whenever objects are rendered, the RenderService will diff the global state against the
	 * context's state and update only the GL states that are necessary.
