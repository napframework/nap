	/**
	 * With this client you can send nap api events in the form of a JSON formatted text message to a server. When the server issues
	 * a reply the message can be interpreted as a nap api event and is, when accepted, forwarded to the API service.
	 * This allows you to use the NAP API system to send and respond to server requests.
	 *
	 * A reply is accepted when your application exposes a signature (method) that matches the signature of
	 * the received message. When accepted, the right callback in your application is automatically triggered by a
	 * nap::APIComponentInstance. Look at the documentation of the nap::APIComponentInstance and nap::APICallBack
	 * for more information.
	 *
	 * For example, to send a message in the form of an api request to a server:
	 *~~~~~{.cpp}
	 *		// Create request
	 *		nap::APIEventPtr server_request = std::make_unique<nap::APIEvent>("getMotorSpeed");
	 *
	 *		// Add argument
	 *		server_request->addArgument<APIInt>("number", 1);
	 *
	 *		// Send
	 *		nap::utility::ErrorState error;
	 *		if (!client->send(std::move(server_request), error))
	 *		{
	 *			nap::Logger::error(error.toString());
	 *		}
	 *~~~~~
	 * You can control what the client does when it a receives a connection update or message from the server.
	 * By default messages are NOT converted into api events, only into web-socket events.
	 * By changing the 'Mode' to 'APIEvent' or 'Both' the client will try to convert every message from the server into an API event.
	 * The api event is forwarded to your application (if the system accepts it). When only 'APIEvent' is selected,
	 * no web-socket events are created. When 'Both' is selected, the client will create both api and web-socket events.
	 * If the message can't be converted into an api event only the web-socket event is forwarded.
	 * To catch api-events use a nap::APIComponentInstance, to catch web-socket events use a nap::WebSocketComponent.
	 *
	 * NOTE: When the 'Mode' is set to 'APIEvent' NO connection updates (open, close and failed) are created.
	 * When 'Verbose' is turned on the client will issue warnings if a message can't be converted into an api event.
	 *
	 * A 'ticket' can be added to specify additional authorization information (username / password).
	 * This information is automatically given to the server when the client tries to establish a connection.
	 * The server can accept or reject the connection based on that information. When no ticket is provided
	 * the client will try to connect without any authorization.
