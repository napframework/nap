	/**
	 * Allows for receiving and responding to nap api messages over a web-socket. Implements the IWebSocketServer interface.
	 *
	 * When a client sends a JSON formatted text message to the server, the server tries to convert the message into 
	 * a nap api event. When the api event is accepted by your application, it is forwarded to the API service. 
	 * This allows you to use the NAP API system to send and respond to client requests. 
	 * With this server you can also send replies to a client in the form of a nap api event. 
	 *
	 * A client request is accepted when your application exposes a signature (method) that matches the signature of
	 * the received message. When accepted, the right callback in your application is automatically triggered by a
	 * nap::APIComponentInstance. Look at the documentation of the nap::APIComponentInstance and nap::APICallBack
	 * for more information.
	 * 
	 * The message sent by the client must contain at least one JSON formatted nap::APIMessage object, for example:
	 *
	 *	{
	 *		"Objects":
	 *		[
	 *			{
	 *				"Type": "nap::APIMessage",
	 *				"mID": "01",
	 *				"Name": "getMotorSpeed",
	 *				"Arguments":
	 *				[
	 *					{
	 *						"Type": "nap::APIInt",
	 *						"Name": "number",
	 *						"mID": "02",
	 *						"Value": 1
	 *					}
	 *				]
	 *			}
	 *		]
	 *	}
	 *
	 * You can combine multiple nap::APIMessage objects into a single message. Every nap::APIMessage object is converted
	 * into a separate nap api event, before handed over to the running application.
	 * 
	 * Example of a server reply in response to the client request:
	 * 
	 *		// Create response, copy over query id and client connection handle
	 *		APIWebSocketEventPtr reply = std::make_unique<APIEvent>("motorSpeed", client_request->getID());
	 *
	 *		// Add current motor speed value
	 *		reply->addArgument<APIFloat>("speed", mMotorSpeed);
	 *
	 *		// Send response to client
	 *		if (!server->send(std::move(reply), client_connection, error))
	 *		{
	 *			nap::Logger::error(error.toString());
	 *		}
	 *
	 * When replying to a nap api message it is advised to copy the unique id of the request. This allows the client to match the request to a server reply.
	 * The client can manually parse the json formatted text or, when making use of a nap::APIWebSocketClient, automatically parse the reply without inspection.
	 * See nap::APIWebSocketConnection for more information.
	 *
	 * You can control what the server does when it a receives a connection update or message from a client.
	 * By default the server tries to convert every message from a client into an api event.
	 * The api event is forwarded to your application (if the system accepts it).
	 * By changing the 'Mode' to 'Both' every message is converted into both an api and web-socket event. 
	 * Both are forwarded to your application. If the message can't be converted into an api event only the 
	 * web-socket event is forwarded. When 'WebSocketEvent' is selected, only web-socket events are created. In this mode
	 * the server is a regular nap::WebSocketServer. To catch api-events use a nap::APIComponentInstance, 
	 * to catch web-socket events use a nap::WebSocketComponent.
	 
	 * NOTE: When the 'Mode' is set to 'APIEvent' NO connection updates (open, close and failed) are created.
	 * When 'Verbose' is turned on the server will issue warnings if a message can't be converted into an api.
	 * When conversion fails the server always sends an error reply to the client. Every server error reply starts with: "ERROR:", 
	 * together with the reason for failure, for example: "ERROR: MyServer: unable to parse json".
