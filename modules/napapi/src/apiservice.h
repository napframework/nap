	/**
	 * Offers a C-Style interface that can be used to send and receive data from a running NAP application.
	 * Use this interface to wrap a REST-like interface around your NAP application.
	 *
	 * Use the various utility functions, such as sendInt() and sendIntArray() to send data to a running NAP application.
	 * All 'send' methods copy the arguments by value, making it hard to leak memory.
	 * The copied data is converted (moved) into a nap::APIEvent and forwarded to an interested nap::APIComponent.
	 * Install listeners on an api component to provide logic when a function is called through this interface.
	 *
	 * Messages with variable number of arguments can be constructed and sent using sendMessage().
	 * This call accepts a JSON formatted string that can contain multiple API messages as a bundle, 
	 * where each message contains a variable number of arguments. See sendMessage() for more information.
	 * 
	 * When sending data to an app a unique nap::APIEvent is created. Events aren't processed immediately but stored in a queue.
	 * This ensures that the recording and processing of api events is thread-safe, similar to how osc events are processed.
	 * To process all the recorded api events call processEvents(). processEvents() is called for you automatically when using an application event handler.
	 * 
	 * This service can also be used to dispatch events to an external environment, often as a reply to a previously received message.
	 * In order for an external environment to receive an event it needs to listen to the messageDispatched signal.
	 * Events are dispatched immediately, without being queued.
	 * 
	 * To dispatch an event from a NAP application, often in reply to a previously received message, use dispatchEvent().

		 * Interprets the string as JSON and sends the individual messages as separate events to a NAP application.

		 * Every message holds a custom number of nap::APIValue's and is therefore a powerful way to send custom information to a NAP application.
		 *
		 * After extracting all the messages, which translate into separate events, the system checks if the application accepts the data by matching a declared nap::APISignature.
