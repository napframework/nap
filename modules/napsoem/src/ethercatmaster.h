	/**
	 * Ethercat Master Device. Derive from this class to implement your own ethercat master.
	 * 
	 * The Ethercat master finds and manages Ethercat slaves on the network.
	 * An Ethernet port is opened on start. The port to open is controlled by the 'Adapter' property. 
	 * Without a valid port the startup procedure will fail. 
	 * The SOEM service prints all available ports on startup of the service. 
	 * Pick one of the ports to discover slaves on the network.
	 *
	 * Override the various virtual functions to read / write to the slave SDO.
	 * Override the 'onProcess' function to exchange runtime SDO input and output data. 
	 * onProcess() is called from a separate thread. It is your responsibility to time the data transfers.
	 * Error reporting and slave recovery is handled by this master on a separate thread.
	 *
	 * IMPORTANT: On Linux and OSX you must run the application that uses the 
	 * Ethercat master as administrator, ie: with sudo privileges. Failure
	 * to do so will result in a failure to start the device, and therefore
	 * the application.
	 *
	 * IMPORTANT: winpcap is required on windows. Download it here: https://www.winpcap.org/
	 * The SOEM module builds against the winpcap library but does not ship with the dll or driver.
	 * Installing winpcap should be enough. Administator priviliges are not required.
