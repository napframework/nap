     * GpioPin can be used to read or write to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry PI. You can set the pin number by setting
     * the "Pin" property and set its mode by setting the "Mode" property.
     * The GpioService uses "wiringPiSetupGpio()" which means the service uses the Broadcom GPIO pin numbers directly
     * with no re-mapping.
     * Write calls will always be asynchronous and not block the calling thread. Read calls are synchronous and perform
     * a mutex lock to ensure thread-safety.
     * See https://pinout.xyz/ to help with mapping.
     * The PiGPIOPin wraps the core functionality of wiringPi, see : http://wiringpi.com/reference/
