		 * The deserializer can operate in two modes: using only raw pointers or without any raw pointers at all. The main distinction
		 * between the two modes lie in hotloading: in the normal flow of operation, all objects are managed by ResourceManager and
		 * internally by ObjectPtrManager. These classes enable the hotloading of objects and they do so by patching internal pointers 
		 * in non-raw pointers like ObjectPtr, ResourcePtr, ComponentPtr. In such situations, raw pointers are not allowed. 
		 * However, ObjectPtr and alike are not thread-safe and they should only be used from the main thread. In cases where objects
		 * are deserialized directly without the use of ResourceManager, you can use raw pointers instead of ObjectPtr and alike. 
		 * By enabling OnlyRawPointers or NoRawPointers, the deserializer verifies the correct use of all pointers throughout deserialization.
