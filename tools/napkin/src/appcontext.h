	/**
	 * The AppContext (currently a singleton) holds the 'globally' kept application state. 
	 * All authored objects reside here.
	 * 
	 * It has signals to notify the other application components of global state changes such as data file access and
	 * provides the client with convenience methods that may change the application state.
	 *
	 * This class currently acts much like a model in MVC: Operations on the data should happen through AppContext,
	 * such that the rest of the application can react and update accordingly.
	 *
	 * The app context manages nap::Core, it is therefore required that the entire context needs to be destroyed if core needs to be re-initialized.
	 * In other words: for every project that you want to load a new app context needs to be created and the old needs to be destroyed.
	 * Unfortunately this is necessary because core sources dynamic libraries that at this point in time can't be freed properly on all systems.
	 *
	 * The context points to a document that is manipulated by the editor. 
	 * If core fails to initialize, creation and manipulation of resources won't work. 
	 * Core is initialized when a project is loaded.
	 * 
	 * TODO: Data manipulation methods and signals should really live in their own class.
