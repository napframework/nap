	 * 2D texture zoom and pan camera controller.
	 *
	 * Allows for freely moving around and zooming into a 2D texture using an orthographic camera.
	 * Use the 'frameTexture' function to adjust the scale and position of your texture, ensuring it fits perfectly in the viewport.
	 *
	 * This component updates the projection and transform matrix of an orthographic camera, based on pointer input events.
	 * It therefore requires the following components to be present on the same entity.
	 *
	 * - a nap::Transform component
	 * - a nap::PointerInputComponent
	 * - a nap::OrthoCameraComponent
	 *
	 * After calling 'frameTexture':
	 *     - The texture is placed at a depth of (z)0.
	 *     - The camera is placed at (xy)0 at a depth of (z)5.
	 *     - The camera planes will match the size of the viewport.
	 *     - The near and far clipping planes are setup to capture the framed texture.
	 *
	 * Not calling 'frameTexture' allows you to use your own texture scale and orthographic camera settings.
	 * Note that for the component to work properly it can't have any parent transform, if it does the the result is undefined.
