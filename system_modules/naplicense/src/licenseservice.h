	 * On initialization the service looks for a '.key' and '.license' file in the directory

	 * with a good layer of initial protection. If you want a more fail safe solution,
	 * consider using a license server instead. NAP however will not be able to provide that functionality,
	 * considering many NAP application must run stand-alone without an internet connection.

	 * It is recommended to compile the public key into your application as a string or into your
	 * application module as a 'nap::PublicKey'.
