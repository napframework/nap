	 * Service that manages connections to external input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, joystick and controller.
	 * By default all connections to all available devices are opened automatically, ie: 
	 * all joysticks, game controllers etc. should be available to the system after initialization.
	 * When a controller disconnects it is removed from the system until connected again. 
	 * This ensures that controllers can be connected / disconnected during sessions.
	 *
	 * A Game Controller is a Joystick that makes use of a pre-defined mapping, ie: LeftTrigger etc.
	 * Most popular game controllers are supported out of the box such as the xbox live controller etc.
	 * If a controller isn't supported natively it is considered to be a Joystick where the user has to
	 * interpret the various buttons.
