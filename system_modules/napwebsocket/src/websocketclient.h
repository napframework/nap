	 * A 'ticket' can be added to every client to specify additional authorization information. 
	 * This information is automatically given to the server when the client tries to establish a connection. 
	 * The server can accept or reject the connection based on that information. When no ticket is provided
	 * the client will try to connect without any authorization.
