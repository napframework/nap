	/**
	 * Video playback device. 
	 *
	 * Decodes a video, from a list of videos, in a background thread and stores the result in a set of YUV textures.
	 * The textures are filled with the latest frame data on update(), which is a non-blocking operation.
	 * The nap::VideoService calls update() automatically each frame. 
	 *
	 * The main thread will consume the frames when they are present in the frame queue and their timestamp has 'passed'.
	 * Internally the textures are only updated when needed. YUV to RGB Conversion can be done in a shader.
	 *
	 * Videos are cached internally. This means that all videos in the playlist are created on start(), including the associated video format and video codec contexts.
	 * This ensures that a video can be started and stopped fast, without having to re-open a video when switching.
	 * The IO and decode threads are spawned on play() and stopped on stopPlayback().
	 *
	 * Note that the YUV textures are (re)-created when the video dimensions change from selection to selection.
	 * This is done to ensure there is always only 1 set of YUV textures allocated on the GPU per video player instance, 
	 * instead of a set of textures per video. A valid set of textures is always available after a successful call to selectVideo()
	 * Listen to the VideoChanged signal to get notified about a video change.
	 *
	 * Every video must contain a video stream, the audio stream is optional. 
	 * Use a nap::VideoAudioComponent to decode and play back the audio of a video.
	 * Without a nap::VideoAudioComponent no audio is decoded and therefore played back.
	 *
	 * Do not call start() and stop() at runtime, unless you want to completely restart the device and free all memory, 
	 * start() and stop() are called automatically by the engine at the appropiate time.
	 * Use play() and stopPlayback() instead to start and stop playback of the currently selected video.
	 * You always have to call play() after selecting a different video:
	 *
	 * ~~~~~{.cpp}
	 *	utility::ErrorState error;
	 *	if (!mVideoPlayer->selectVideo(new_selection, error))
	 *		nap::Logger::error(error.toString());
	 *	else
	 *		mVideoPlayer->play();
	 * ~~~~~
