	 * GPU Buffer for storing (nested) data structures.

	 * Allocates all required host (staging) and device buffers based on the specified properties.
	 *
	 * The layout of the struct buffer is defined by a StructBufferDescriptor. This descriptor is used to denote the
	 * buffer layout, allocate the right amount of memory, and possibly store information on how fill the buffer
	 * accordingly. As the size of the buffer is determined by the descriptor, it is important that it matches the
	 * declaration of the shader variable it is bound to. Initialization of buffer bindings may fail otherwise.
	 *
	 * If a 'FillPolicy' is available, the buffer will also be uploaded to immediately. Alternatively, 'Clear' sets all
	 * of the buffer values to zero on init(). 'FillPolicy' and 'Clear' are mutually exclusive and the former has
	 * priority over the latter.
	 *
	 * Supported types are primitive types that can be mapped to VkFormat.
	 * @tparam T primitive value data type
	 * @tparam PROPERTY property for identifying the buffer usage and access type
