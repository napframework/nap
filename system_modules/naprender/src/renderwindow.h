	/**
	 * Vulkan render window that can be declared in JSON. 
	 *
	 * Multiple presentation (display) modes are available to choose from. The selected presentation mode
	 * controls how the rendered images are presented to screen: in sync, out of sync or tied to the refresh rate of the monitor.
	 * It is however possible that the selected presentation mode is not supported by the graphics hardware,
	 * if that's the case the window will revert to FIFO_KRH, which is the presentation mode
	 * every vulkan compatible device must support. A warning is issued if the selected presentation mode
	 * is unavailable. 
	 *
	 * In order to improve performance, consider lowering the sample count and disable sample based shading.
	 * If sample based shading is requested but not supported, it is disabled and a warning is issued. 
	 * If the requested multi-sample count exceeds what is supported by the hardware, the highest available sample
	 * count is picked and a warning is issued.
	 *
	 * Initialization will fail when the nap::RenderService is configured to run headless.
	 * When headless rendering is enabled, the engine is initialized without surface and swapchain support,
	 * which are required by a nap::RenderWindow to display images on screen.
