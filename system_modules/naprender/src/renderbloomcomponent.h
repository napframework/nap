	/**
	 * Pre- or post-processing effect that blurs the input texture at a downsampled resolution into internally managed
	 * rendertargets.
	 *
	 * This component manages its own render target and plane to render to.
	 * The plane is automatically scaled to fit the bounds of the render target.
	 *
	 * `InputTexture` is blitted to an internally managed render target, and then blurred based on the specified pass
	 * count. Each blur 'pass' then comprises two passes; horizontal and vertical. The gaussian sampling kernel size can
	 * be specified with the 'Kernel' property. Each subsequent pass performs a horizontal and vertical blur at half the
	 * resolution of the former pass, with the first being at half the resolution of `InputTexture`.
	 * 
	 * When the bloom passes have been completed, the result is blitted to `OutputTexture`. `InputTexture` and
	 * `OutputTexture` are allowed to refer to the same `nap::RenderTexture`.
	 *
	 * Simply declare the component in json and call RenderBloomComponentInstance::draw() in the render part of your
	 * application, in between nap::RenderService::beginHeadlessRecording() and nap::RenderService::endHeadlessRecording().
	 *
	 * This component uses the default naprender blur shader and automatically sets its shader variables based on this
	 * component's properties configuration.
