	/**
	 * Resource part of the Renderable3DTextComponentInstance. Draws flat text in 3D space.
	 * Use this component when you want to render text at a specific location in the world
	 * Use the normalize toggle to render the text at the origin of the scene with a unit size of 1.
	 * When rendering in normalized mode the initial text is used to compute the normalization factor.
	 * This ensures that when changing text at runtime the size of the letters don't change as well.
	 * Use the Renderable2DTextComponent to draw text in screen (pixel) space with an orthographic camera.
	 *
	 * 3D text can only be rendered using the render service, similar to how 3D meshes are rendered.
	 * The text can be transformed, scaled and rotated. It's best to render 3D text using a perspective camera.
	 * The font size directly influences the size of the text unless normalization is turned on.
	 * When normalization is turned on the text is rendered centered on the origin with -0.5-0,5 bounds.
	 *
	 * It is possible to cache multiple lines at once, where each line can be selected and drawn individually inside a render loop.
	 * This is useful when you want the same component to render multiple lines of text, removing the need to declare a component for each individual line.
	 * You cannot update or add a line of text when rendering a frame: inside the render loop.
	 * Only update or add new lines of text on update. You can however change the position and line of text to draw inside the render loop.
