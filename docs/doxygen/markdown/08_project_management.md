# Overview {#proj_overview}

NAP leverages a <a href="https://cmake.org/" target="_blank">CMake</a> build system to provide all the basic project management facilities of the framework.  The access points to this system are all within the tools folder in the root of the framework release.  Convenience shortcuts to regenerate the IDE/Unix makefile project and package the NAP project also sit within each project.

We'll go over the basic tasks here and then cover some more advanced topics in the [Custom CMake](@ref custom_cmake) section for those who want to take things further.

# Windows {#proj_overview_win64}
## Create Project {#proj_creation_win64}

Follow the steps below to create a new project titled MyFirstProject.

Note: You're required to provide the project name in PascalCase so that you get proper case in your class definition for the new project.  The pascal case name is also used for the packaged project name.

1. Open a command prompt
2. Change into your NAP framework directory
3. Create the project
```
tools\create_project MyFirstProject
```
4. The NAP project will the created and Visual Studio solution generated.  The Visual Studio solution will be shown in Explorer, located in `projects\myfirstproject`.

## Configure Modules For Project {#module_config_win64}

Within each project folder you'll find the `project.json` file which contains (among other things) the list of modules used by the project.

Below is a sample `project.json` from our MyFirstProject (located at `projects\myfirstproject\project.json`):

```
{
    "Type": "nap::ProjectInfo",
    "mID": "ProjectInfo",
    "Title": "MyFirstProject",
    "Version": "0.1.0",
    "RequiredModules": [
        "mod_napapp",
        "mod_napcameracontrol",
        "mod_napparametergui",
        "mod_myfirstproject"
    ],
    "Data": "data/objects.json",
    "ServiceConfig": "",
    "PathMapping": "cache/path_mapping.json"
}
```

To update this list simply add and remove entries to the `RequiredModules` list in the JSON.  The module names should match the module directory names in `\modules` and `\user_modules`.

Once you've updated your `project.json` run regenerate.bat within the project folder to update the Visual Studio solution.

## Create Shared Module {#module_creation_win64}

Follow the steps below to create a new module named MyFirstModule.
1. Open a command prompt
2. Change into your NAP framework directory
3. Create the module
```
tools\create_module MyFirstModule
```
4. The module will the created in `user_modules\myfirstmodule` and a Visual Studio solution generated

While it's possible to open the module Visual Studio solution directly, it's often easier to include the module in a project and work on the module from there as module DLLs are only updated into projects when the project using the module is built.

## Create Project Module {#project_module_creation_win64}

Unlike the shared module created in the previous section, a project module is specific to a single project. Working with a project module has the benefit of containing all code related to the project within the project's directory whilst retaining the ability to create components which can be worked on via Napkin and integrated into your project structure.

Follow the steps below to add a module to project MyFirstProject.
1. Open a command prompt
2. Change into your NAP framework directory
3. Create the module
```
tools\create_project_module MyFirstProject
```
4. The module will the created in `projects\myfirstproject\module`, added to your `project.json` and the Visual Studio solution for the project updated

Alternatively a project module can included when the project is created by specifying the `--with-module` option into `create_project`
```
tools\create_project MyFirstProject --with-module
```
	
## Package Project For Release {#package_win64}

Packaging a project provides an archive containing the project, its data, all required libraries and optionally Napkin.  In the NAP beta release projects are packaged to ZIP archives which when extracted provide for direct access to the project data and JSON, allowing for easy editing once deployed.  Options for creating installers for projects may be explored for a future NAP release.  At this time all packaged projects use release build configuration.

Packaging a project with default settings:
1. Navigate to your project (normally within `projects`) with Explorer
2. Run package.bat

By default projects are zipped and contain Napkin.  Projects can be left in uncompressed in a folder by running package.bat from a command prompt and adding the option `--no-zip`.  Napkin can be left out via `--no-napkin`.  Excluding Napkin can save a considerable amount of space if you don't intend on using it.  Other minor options and shorthand versions of the options above can be viewed by running `package.bat --help`.

Project packaging is also accessible from by command prompt in the NAP root via the command `tools\package_project PROJECT_NAME`.  The same options as above apply.

# macOS {#proj_overview_macos}
## Create Project {#proj_creation_macos}

Follow the steps below to create a new project titled MyFirstProject.

Note: You're required to provide the project name in PascalCase so that you get proper case in your class definition for the new project.  The pascal case name is also used for the packaged project name.

1. Open a terminal
2. Change into your NAP framework directory
3. Create the project
```
./tools/create_project MyFirstProject
```
4. The NAP project will the created and Xcode project generated.  The Xcode project will be shown in Finder, located in `projects/myfirstproject`.

## Configure Modules For Project {#module_config_macos}

Within each project folder you'll find the `project.json` file which contains (among other things) the list of modules used by the project.

Below is a sample `project.json` from our MyFirstProject (located at `projects/myfirstproject/project.json`):

```
{
    "Type": "nap::ProjectInfo",
    "mID": "ProjectInfo",
    "Title": "MyFirstProject",
    "Version": "0.1.0",
    "RequiredModules": [
        "mod_napapp",
        "mod_napcameracontrol",
        "mod_napparametergui",
        "mod_myfirstproject"
    ],
    "Data": "data/objects.json",
    "ServiceConfig": "",
    "PathMapping": "cache/path_mapping.json"
}
```

To update this list simply add and remove entries to the `RequiredModules` list in the JSON.  The module names should match the module directory names in `/modules` and `/user_modules`.

Once you've updated your `project.json` run regenerate within the project folder to update the Xcode project.

## Create Shared Module {#module_creation_macos}

Follow the steps below to create a new module named MyFirstModule.
1. Open a terminal
2. Change into your NAP framework directory
3. Create the module
```
./tools/create_module MyFirstModule
```
4. The module will the created in `user_modules/myfirstmodule` and an Xcode project generated

While it's possible to open the module Xcode project directly, it's often easier to include the module in the project you initially intend to use it with and work on the module from there.

## Create Project Module {#project_module_creation_macos}

Unlike the shared module created in the previous section, a project module is specific to a single project. Working with a project module has the benefit of containing all code related to the project within the project's directory whilst retaining the ability to create components which can be worked on via Napkin and integrated into your project structure.

Follow the steps below to add a module to project MyFirstProject.
1. Open a command prompt
2. Change into your NAP framework directory
3. Create the module
```
./tools/create_project_module MyFirstProject
```
4. The module will the created in `projects/myfirstproject/module`, added to your `project.json` and the Xcode project for the project updated

Alternatively a project module can included when the project is created by specifying the `--with-module` option into `create_project`
```
./tools/create_project MyFirstProject --with-module
```

## Package Project For Release {#package_macos}

Packaging a project provides an archive containing the project, its data, all required libraries and optionally Napkin.  In the NAP beta release projects are packaged to ZIP archives which when extracted provide for direct access to the project data and JSON, allowing for easy editing once deployed.  Options for creating installers for projects may be explored for a future NAP release.  At this time all packaged projects use release build configuration.

Note that a script `Unquarantine Project.command` is provided with the packaged project.  On systems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper_(macOS)" target="_blank">macOS' Gatekeeper</a> enabled (which is turned on by default) this script should be run on the deployment device before launching the project. The script is executed by pressing ctrl-click on `Unquarantine Project.command` in Finder and selecting Open. Any presented permissions dialogs should be approved. In a future release support for application bundles and codesigning will be assessed.

Packaging a project with default settings:
1. Navigate to your project (normally within `projects`) with Finder
2. Run package

By default projects are zipped and contain Napkin.  Projects can be left in uncompressed in a folder by running package from a terminal and adding the option `--no-zip`.  Napkin can be left out via `--no-napkin`.  Excluding Napkin can save a considerable amount of space if you don't intend on using it.  Other minor options and shorthand versions of the options above can be viewed by running `package --help`.

Project packaging is also accessible from by command prompt in the NAP root via the command `./tools/package_project PROJECT_NAME`.  The same options as above apply.

# Linux {#proj_overview_linux}
## Create Project {#proj_creation_linux}

Follow these steps to create a new project titled MyFirstProject.

Note: You're required to provide the project name in PascalCase so that you get proper case in your class definition for the new project.  The pascal case name is also used for the packaged project name.

1. Open a terminal
2. Change into your NAP framework directory
3. Create the project
```
./tools/create_project MyFirstProject
```
4. The NAP project will the created and project Unix makefile system generated.  The project will be located in `projects/myfirstproject` and the build system is located in the `build` folder within

## Configure Modules For Project {#module_config_linux}

Within each project folder you'll find the `project.json` file which contains (among other things) the list of modules used by the project.

Below is a sample `project.json` from our MyFirstProject (located at `projects/myfirstproject/project.json`):

    ],
    "Data": "data/objects.json",
    "ServiceConfig": "",
    "PathMapping": "cache/path_mapping.json"
}
```

To update this list simply add and remove entries to the `modules` list in the JSON.  The module names should match the module directory names in `/modules` and `/user_modules`.

Changes to your `project.json` will be automatically pulled in when you next build the project.

## Create Shared Module {#module_creation_linux}

Follow the steps below to create a new module named MyFirstModule.
1. Open a terminal
2. Change into your NAP framework directory
3. Create the module

./tools/create_project MyFirstProject --with-module
```

## Package Project For Release {#package_linux}

Packaging a project provides an archive containing the project, its data, all required libraries and optionally Napkin.  In the NAP beta release projects are packaged to XZipped tarballs which when extracted provide for direct access to the project data and JSON, allowing for easy editing once deployed.  Options for creating installers for projects may be explored for a future NAP release.  At this time all packaged projects use release build configuration.

Packaging a project with default settings:
1. Navigate to your project
```
cd projects/myfirstproject
```
2. Run package
```
./package
```

By default projects are compressed and contain Napkin.  Projects can be left uncompressed in a folder by adding the option `--no-zip`.  Napkin can be left out via `--no-napkin`.  Excluding Napkin can save a considerable amount of space if you don't intend on using it.  Other minor options and shorthand versions of the options above can be viewed by running `package --help`.

Project packaging is also accessible from by command prompt in the NAP root via the command `./tools/package_project PROJECT_NAME`.  The same options as above apply.

# Custom CMake {#custom_cmake}

For the NAP beta release we've focused on providing a streamlined environment for people to start making projects and modules against the framework along with of course some testing out of the demos.  However we've also provided some extensibility in the <a href="https://cmake.org/" target="_blank">CMake</a> system for people who would like to take things a little further.

CMake itself is vast and complex system and far beyond the scope of this document but we look forward to hearing from you and getting feedback on limitations reached with the current hooks we've provided for custom CMake logic.

Included below is information on how to add custom CMake logic to your projects and modules, a preview into the world of including third party dependencies cross platform through to packaging with projects, plus a little something extra for those who need even more flexibility.

## Project {#custom_cmake_proj}

Those looking to add extra CMake logic at the project level are able to via a hook provided with a `project_extra.cmake` file in the project root directory.

If `project_extra.cmake` exists it will be included into the project template when the solution is regenerated.  Within `project_extra.cmake` `${PROJECT_NAME}` can be used as in any standard CMake project and `${NAP_ROOT}` points to the root of the NAP installation.  `CMakeLists.txt` within the project root shouldn't be modified (and may be updated in future releases of NAP).

Below is an example of a simple `project_extra.cmake` with an added include path:
```
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/pathToHeaders)
```

In this example <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.6/command/target_include_directories.html" target="_blank">target_include_directories</a> is used with `${PROJECT_NAME}` referring to the project target and `CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR` being used to refer to the project root directory.  It's important to remember that `project_extra.cmake` is included within NAP's existing CMake project and as such doesn't replace the existing template and as a result this limits what functions make sense within this supplementary file.

When a project is packaged the entire `data` directory from the project is included, alongside the core libraries, the modules and their third party dependencies.  If you need to include anything extra into the packaged project do so using CMake's <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.6/command/install.html" target="_blank">install</a> command.  Below is an example `project_extra.json` installing an extra file `example.txt` from the project root into the packaged project.

```
install(FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/example.txt DESTINATION .)
```

## Module {#custom_cmake_module}

Similar to the [custom project CMake above](@ref custom_cmake_proj) NAP provides a hook for custom logic in user modules by the way of a `module_extra.cmake` file in the module root directory.

The same limitations and approaches apply to this supplementary CMake logic file as to `project_extra.cmake`: `${PROJECT_NAME}` identifies the module target, `CMakeLists.txt` shouldn't be replaced, and this file is included into our standard NAP module CMake project.

## Third Party Dependencies {#custom_cmake_thirdparty}

The focus here will be on including a new thirdparty dependency into a module but the same steps apply for including it instead directly into a project, substituting `module_extra.cmake` with `project_extra.cmake`.

The steps provided create a CMake module for the third party library, which we bring in as an import library.  There are other ways to implement this with CMake but we'll here be focused on an import library approach using a CMake module.

Let's work on with an imaginary libfoo that we want to bring into our user module mod_myfirstmodule.  We're going to keep the thirdparty library sitting alongside the module, but this is of course up to you.  Let's envisage that we have libfoo prebuilt for all three platforms as a shared library.

The first step for including a new third party library will be to make (or import) a CMake module file.  Many third party libraries will come with a CMake module ready for your use.  Below we're going to create a simple one from scratch.

Within the `cmake` directory in the NAP root create a CMake module file `Findfoo.cmake` with the following:

```
# Setup our fictional library paths
set(FOO_DIR ${NAP_ROOT}/user_modules/mod_myfirstmodule/thirdparty/libfoo)
set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES ${FOO_DIR}/include)
if (WIN32)
    set(FOO_LIBS_DIR ${FOO_DIR}/msvc/bin)
    set(FOO_LIBS ${FOO_LIBS_DIR}/libfoo.lib)
    set(FOO_LIBS_DLL ${FOO_LIBS_DIR}/libfoo.dll)
elseif(APPLE)
    set(FOO_LIBS_DIR ${FOO_DIR}/macos/bin)
    set(FOO_LIBS ${FOO_LIBS_DIR}/libfoo.dylib)
    set(FOO_LIBS_DLL ${FOO_LIBS})
else()
    set(FOO_LIBS_DIR ${FOO_DIR}/linux/bin)
    set(FOO_LIBS ${FOO_LIBS_DIR}/libfoo.so)
    set(FOO_LIBS_DLL ${FOO_LIBS})
endif()

# Hide from CMake GUI
mark_as_advanced(FOO_DIR)
mark_as_advanced(FOO_LIBS_DIR)

# Standard find package handling
include(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)
find_package_handle_standard_args(foo REQUIRED_VARS FOO_DIR FOO_LIBS FOO_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES)

# Setup our shared import library
add_library(foo SHARED IMPORTED)

# Set shared library and include directory on our import library
set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
                      IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS "Debug;Release"
                      IMPORTED_LOCATION_RELEASE ${FOO_LIBS_DLL}
                      IMPORTED_LOCATION_DEBUG ${FOO_LIBS_DLL}
                      )
                      
# Add Windows import library properties
if(WIN32)
    set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
                          IMPORTED_IMPLIB_RELEASE ${FOO_LIBS}
                          IMPORTED_IMPLIB_DEBUG ${FOO_LIBS}
                          )
endif()
```

Now let's add libfoo into our user module.

Create a file named `module_extra.cmake` in the root of your module directory containing the following:

```
if(NOT TARGET foo)
    find_package(foo REQUIRED)
endif()
set(MODULE_NAME_EXTRA_LIBS foo)

add_include_to_interface_target(mod_fooworker ${FOO_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
```

CMake's <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.6/command/find_package.html" target="_blank">find_package</a> has been used to locate the module, populating `MODULE_NAME_EXTRA_LIBS` will link libfoo to the module and `add_include_to_interface_target` adds the include directory. The first parameter to `add_include_to_interface_target` should be the name of your module.

At this stage the library is now available to include and link on all platforms however if we attempt to run a project using the module on Windows the DLL won't be found.

Let's use a post-build command via <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.6/command/add_custom_command.html" target="_blank">add_custom_command</a> to copy the third party DLL into the project directory by adding the following into the `module_extra.cmake`:

```
if(WIN32)
    # Add post-build step to copy libfoo to bin on Windows
    add_custom_command(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME}
                       POST_BUILD
                       COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} 
                               -E copy
                               $<TARGET_FILE:foo>
                               $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:${PROJECT_NAME}> 
                       )
endif()
```

Your module with its libfoo third party dependency will now build and run on all three platforms.

The last consideration is to ensure the third party shared library is include in the packaged project.  Due to the fact that we've already copied the DLL into the project bin directory on Windows we have already completed that step there.  However on macOS and Linux we need to add this as a step using CMake's <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.6/command/install.html" target="_blank">install</a> command.  Add the following to your `module_extra.cmake`, noting that we're installing the library into the `lib` directory within the package:
```
if(UNIX)
    # Install libfoo into lib directory in packaged project on macOS and Linux
    install(FILES $<TARGET_FILE:foo> DESTINATION lib)
endif()
```

In the end with a minor simplification your `module_extra.cmake` should look like this:
```
if(NOT TARGET foo)
    find_package(foo REQUIRED)
endif()
set(MODULE_NAME_EXTRA_LIBS foo)

add_include_to_interface_target(mod_fooworker ${FOO_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})

if(WIN32)
    # Add post-build step to copy libfoo to bin on Windows
    add_custom_command(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME}
                       POST_BUILD
                       COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} 
                               -E copy
                               $<TARGET_FILE:foo>
                               $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:${PROJECT_NAME}> 
                       )
elseif(UNIX)
    # Install libfoo into the lib directory of packaged projects on macOS and Linux
    install(FILES $<TARGET_FILE:foo> DESTINATION lib)
endif()

```

### macOS RPATH Management {#macos_thirdparty_library_rpath}

One thing to keep an eye out for on macOS is the install name of the third party libraries that you're attempting to integrate.

The install name of a shared library can be viewed in macOS using the command `otool -D`. See this example, showing mpg123:
```
$ otool -D lib/libmpg123.0.dylib
lib/libmpg123.0.dylib:
/Users/username/mpg123-1.25.6/install/osx/lib/libmpg123.0.dylib
```

If that install name were allowed to remain this way any library linked against libout123.0.dylib would look for it at the path shown above. What we want to end up with instead is having our library found in its relative position within the NAP framework directory.

To achieve that let's update the library's install name, prefixing it with `@rpath`:
```
$ install_name_tool -id @rpath/libmpg123.0.dylib lib/libmpg123.0.dylib
```

We can then check the results by running `otool` again:
```
$ otool -D lib/libmpg123.0.dylib
lib/libmpg123.0.dylib:
@rpath/libmpg123.dylib
```

Anything using our library with the updated install name (in this case mpg123) would then need to be rebuilt to pull in the changed path.

One risk with RPATH management and third party libraries is in the case where you're integrating a library that you also have installed on your system via eg. Homebrew or MacPorts. In this case it's possible to unknowningly be building and running against the system-level third party library. There are a number of ways to detect this, one of which is while running your project using `lsof` in a terminal and grepping the output to ensure that the correct instance of your library is being used. If this issue goes unresolved you're likely to run into problems when the project or module is used on a another system.

# Path Mapping System {#path_mapping}

NAP uses a path mapping system based on simple JSON files to manage the directory relationships between the project binaries, Napkin and modules in the different arrangements of working against a Framework Release, from a Packaged App, or even against Source. The path mapping for the platform and context you're using will be deployed by the build system to `cache/path_mapping.json` relative to both the project directory and the project binary output.

In the very large majority of cases NAP will manage these paths for you and you won't need to pay attention to this system. There is however a provision for custom project-specific path mappings which get pulled in from the directory `config/custom_path_mappings` within the project directory, containing content similar to `tools/platform/path_mappings` in the Framework Release. Only the platforms and contexts you want to modify should be defined. NAP will locate these custom mappings and deploy them as expected. 

Custom path mappings are fairly beta at this stage and if you end up finding a need for them we would be interested in hearing from you, feel free to get in touch on the forum.
