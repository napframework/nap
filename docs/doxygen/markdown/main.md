=======================

# Description

NAP (New Amsterdam Platform) is a platform that unifies different creative coding platforms. If you're the kind of person that wants to create dynamic content for high resolution screens or drive thousands of lights in a club, NAP might be the tool for you. Nap provides a single platform where you can use any protocol (such as Midi, Osc or Artnet) in conjunction with a 3D graphics engine to create real-time content that is transmitted to any device you like. NAP is built to scale up to a large number of output devices: many speakers, many lasers, many screens.

NAPs design is intended to be as open as possible: there is little fixed functionality, but there are a lot of useful blocks that can be tied together by a user to create the experience you desire. As a user, you can build new blocks yourself and throw them in the mix to fulfill your creative vision. To push creativity, NAP is built to provide extremely fast iteration times. Any change made while the app is running is updated immediately into the running application.
