Welcome
=======================

[NAP](https://nap.tech) is an [open source](https://github.com/napframework), low overhead, real-time control & visualization plaform. Create fast, modular and (above all) stable applications to interact with the world around you.

Use any protocol (OSC, MIDI, Artnet, WebSocket etc) in combination with a 3D graphics and sound engine to create real-time content that is transmitted to any device you like. NAP is built to scale up to a large number of input and output devices: many displays, many lights, many speakers, many sensors, many servos.

## Features

NAP Framework ships with many useful modules, including: a `Vulkan 2D/3D` render engine, `Vulkan Compute` module, a multi-channel `audio engine` for music playback, recording and analysis, a `sequencer` to control parameters in real-time, an `editor` to author application content, a `web portal` to control and monitor NAP applications in a browser, a system for creating and loading `presets`, a `video player` powered by FFmpeg and a `Python` programming interface.

NAP also has built in support for many common protocols and standards, including: WebSocket, MIDI, OSC, Artnet, Serial, EtherCAT, OpenCV, SQLite and many others. NAP has been battle tested in production for years. For more information about NAP, how it is commonly used and what it can do for you, visit the [nap.tech](https://nap.tech) website.

## Philosophy

NAP is completely data driven and heavily influenced by modern game engine design, with one exception: it does not dictate any sort of pipeline. This allows NAP to run on any type of device: from low-power, energy efficient ARM computers such as the Raspberry Pi to industrial PCs and x86 gaming rigs. 

NAP applications are lean and mean: only package and ship what you actually use. On top of that NAP is easy to extend: build you own modules, resources, devices and components. NAP wants you to be safe and validates data for you on initialization. Applications are also responsive: hot-load content changes directly in to the running application. On top of that NAP is completely cross-platform and supports all modern desktop environments.

## Why

Projects are growing in scope and complexity. Therefore the need for stable and performant software is increasing. Software needs to run for years without having to string together multiple applications or environments. To meet expectations NAP offers you a set of handles to tackle the most demanding creative and industrial problems.
