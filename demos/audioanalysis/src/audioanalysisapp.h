	 * Demo application that shows how to analyze an audio signal in order to extract the output level of a certain frequency band of the signal.
     * Audio is generated using an audio::PlaybackComponent or an audio::AudioInputComponent. The signal is sent to an audio::OutpuComponent so we can hear it and to an audio::LevelMeterComponent that we can adjust with a GUI.
     * The output of the LevelMeterComponent is plotted in the GUI.
