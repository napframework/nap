	/**
	 * Demo application that is called from within the main loop
	 *
	 * Shows a grid that is displaced using a height map.
	 * This application uses 2 new resources: "HeightMesh" and "HeightNormals", both are meshes
	 * These meshes are defined in mod_heightmap, shipped together with this demo.
	 * The app module is compiled in to a dynamic link library, this ensures the objects can be created and adjusted in the editor
	 * 
	 * The height mesh is a plane that links to an image (height map). The plane is displaced along it's normal based on the information
	 * in the image. The normals of the plane are visualized using the height normals mesh. This mesh links to the plane and creates a
	 * normal for every vertex associated with that plane. It also creates some extra vertex attributes to display interpolated normal values
	 * 
	 * The displacement can be adjusted using a blend value. When set to 0 the plane's vertices are not displaced, when set to 1
	 * the vertices are fully displaced. The maximum displacement value is a HeightMesh property.
	 * Shaders are used to calculate the new vertex position based on the vertex attributes associated with both meshes. 
	 * The height mesh stores it's original position alongside the current (max) displacement value. The shader uses that information
	 * to find the right displaced position based on a blend value. Normals are also blended based on the current blend value.
	 * Having access to both start and end vertex data allows us to efficiently compute in-between values, all computations occur on the GPU
	 * Having to re-calculate the normals on the CPU is heavy on a 1024x1024 triangle grid, this is now handled for us by the GPU
	 *
	 * The GUI allows you to toggle normal blending on/off and change the height blend value. When normal blending is turned off
	 * the normals keep pointing upwards, causing the halo effect to be exactly the same with or without displacement.
	 * When blending is turned on the normals are interpolated between the min max displacement values, 
	 * with as a result a more accurate normal representation.
	 *
	 * This demo is relatively heavy as it draws over 3 million primitives to screen, where 1 million primitives are transparent.
	 * It runs fine on most dedicated gpu's (150+ fps) but doesn't work as well on integrated graphics cards (intel etc.).
