	/**
	 * Demo application that is called from within the main loop
	 *
	 * Shows a rotating textured sphere in the center of the viewport
	 * You can use the left mouse button to orbit around the object and 
	 * the right mouse button to zoom in on the object
	 * 
	 * This demo uses 3 important modules: mod_naprender, mod_napinput, mod_napcameracontrol
	 * The sphere is rendered using a simple material that blends 2 colors based on a texture's alpha value.
	 * The sphere is positioned by a transform component and rotated along the y axis by a rotate component.
	 * The camera is placed away from the origin but can be moved using the mouse. The camera looks at
	 * the sphere and uses that information to orbit around the object.
	 * Text is rendered in the middle of the viewport, on top of the sphere, using a nap::Renderable2DTextComponent.
	 *
	 * Mouse and key events are forwarded to the input service, the input service collects input events
	 * and processes all of them on update. Because NAP does not have a default space (objects can
	 * be rendered in multiple ways), you need to specify what input actually means to the application. 
	 * The input router does that for you. This demo uses the default one that forwards the events to every input component
	 * Refer to the cpp-update() call for more information on handling input
