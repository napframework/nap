	/**
	 * This demo renders a long mesh strip and moves it around in the space randomly. Distortions are applied to the mesh
	 * in reaction to peaks and changes in an audio signal. The central component of this app is the
	 * `nap::AudioRoadComponent`, which updates essential compute shader materials and camera movement.
	 * 
	 * A cube map for environmental star reflections is rendered in the first frame, and sampled by the
	 * `nap::RenderAudioRoadComponent`. This demo also includes a depth-of-field and chromatic abberation post-processing
	 * effect.
	 *
	 * Due to the constant nature of NAP resources you will find that the storage buffers defined in the data file have
	 * strict element counts that are difficult to infer by eye. In the default setup they are based on a grid size of
	 * 1024 x 256 vertices (and therefore 1023 x 255 cells). Please be aware that changing the resolution of this grid
	 * currently requires the element counts of several resources to be recomputed.
