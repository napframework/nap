	/**
	 * Demo application that is called from within the main loop
	 *
	 * Shows a plane with a pulsating blob in the middle of the canvas
	 * The blob is procedurally generated in a shader, including lighting
	 * Move the mouse to change the location of the blob on the canvas
	 * Use the left mouse button to rotate the camera
	 * Use the right mouse button to zoom
	 * 
	 * This demo uses ray-casting to resolve the position of the blob on the plane
	 * A ray is cast from the screen in to the world when the mouse is moved
	 * When the ray hits a triangle of the intersection plane the returned (barycentric) coordinates are used to compute the uv coordinates at the hit location
	 * All movement and positioning of the blob happens in uv space!
	 * The intersection plane only has 2 triangles. The plane that is rendered to screen a lot more because of the blob vertex displacement
	 * All shading and lighting is handled by the blob.fragment shader, including the generation of the normals
	 * 
	 * On update a set of shader variables is set, most importantly the accumulated time. 
	 * The blob slowly moves towards it's target. The SmoothOperator is responsible for this effect
	 * Every frame that operator is fed with the current mouse location and moves the blob target towards it using a cheap dampening model.
	 * The velocity of that movement is used by the blob shader to change the blob size and frequency.
	 *
	 * Except for the ray-casting this demo is rather simple. 
	 * The only components are a camera and two planes: one plane is used for intersection the other for rendering
	 * 
	 * Mouse and key events are forwarded to the input service, the input service collects input events
	 * and processes all of them on update. Because NAP does not have a default space (objects can
	 * be rendered in multiple ways), you need to specify what input actually means to the application. 
	 * The input router does that for you. This demo uses the default one that forwards the events to every input component
	 * Refer to the cpp-update() call for more information on handling input
