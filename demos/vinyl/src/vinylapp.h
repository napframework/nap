	/**
	 * Demo application that is called from within the main loop
	 *
	 * This app renders 2 meshes and a background.
	 * You can use the GUI to change the color of the vinyl record
	 * You can change the sleeve image using your favorite paint program and hot-load the changes directly in to
	 * the running application. 
	 * 
	 * This example applies a basic light to both the record and sleeve using the vertex and fragment shader. 
	 * NAP does not include lights by default. 
	 * IMGUI is used to render a GUI panel that you can use to change some properties.
	 *
	 * The meshes are both extracted from 'vinyl_cover.fbx'. Nap automatically detects and converts fbx files.
	 * The output of this conversion is one or multiple binary .mesh file(s). This .mesh file is generated for every individual mesh inside the fbx. 
	 * You can directly link the .mesh objects in to your application using JSON. 
	 * Conversion is performed after compilation when the fbx changed or is new.
	 * Refer to vinylapp.json for the entire app setup
