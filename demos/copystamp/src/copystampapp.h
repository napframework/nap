	/**
	 * Demo application that is called from within the main loop.
	 * Note that this demo does not run well in Debug mode!
	 *
	 * This demo application shows you how to write a custom nap::RenderableComponent.
	 * The component in this demo (nap::RenderableCopyMeshComponent) copies 3D meshes onto the vertices of a reference mesh.
	 * The copy / stamping is handled at render-time, making sure no additional CPU / memory resources are needed.
	 *
	 * Change the number of copies by changing the amount of rows / columns in the StampPlane resource (json).
	 * You can also add more meshes that are copied by editing the CopyMeshes array of the nap::RenderableCopyMeshComponent (json).
	 * Take a look at the custom nap::RenderableCopyMeshComponent to see how the copy stamping at render-time is actually done.
