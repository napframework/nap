	/**
	* Demo application that is called from within the main loop
	*
	* Plays a set of videos. You can select / add or remove videos in JSON
	* The video texture is applied to the background plane and a selection of custom FBX meshes
	* The vertices of the mesh are displaced based on the current video grey scale value.
	* Use the left mouse + mouse button to tumble the camera, right mouse button to zoom
	*
	* This application uses it's own module: mod_videomodulation. 
	* That module exposes 1 resource (VideoMeshFromFile) and 2 components (SelectVideoComponent / SelectVideoMeshComponent).
	* The video mesh from file loads an fbx ans adds 2 attributes that are necessary for displacement. 
	* Both components are used to change the current selection (video / mesh). 
	* 
	* Video playback is handled using FFMpeg. All videos are loaded and validated on startup.
	* The video select component links to all the videos and triggers one for playback, ie: manages current playback state
	* To limit CPU usage NAP does not translate the YUV textures to RGB values, that's best to do on the GPU using a shader.
	* Refer to the video.frag and video.vert shader as an example.
	* 
	* In this example the video is rendered to a 1920x1080 RGB texture using the video shader.
	* This example uses a RenderTarget to render the video to an off screen texture.
	* The resulting texture is used as an input to both the background plane and the foreground (displacement) mesh
	* In the background it's shown using a combination of 2 colors, in the foreground the video data is used to
	* displace and color the mesh vertices. Play around with the on screen controls to select a different mesh or video
	* 
	* We first render the video to it's off screen texture target. The texture it renders to
	* is linked by both the background and displacement material in JSON.
	* We don't have to manually bind the rendered texture to a shader input.
	* After rendering the off screen pass, the background is rendered using an orthographic camera
	* The displacement mesh is rendered on top of the background using a perspective camera.
	*
	* The displacement mesh uses a basic light setup to calculate specular highlights and diffusion.
	* The light position is hard coded in the displacement shader. The camera position is set
	* every frame. The video texture (in combination with) the vertex colors are used to define
	* the specular intensity per fragment
	* 
	* Mouse and key events are forwarded to the input service, the input service collects input events
	* and processes all of them on update. Because NAP does not have a default space (objects can
	* be rendered in multiple ways), you need to specify what input actually means to the application.
	* The input router does that for you. This demo uses the default one that forwards the events to every input component
	* Refer to the cpp-update() call for more information on handling input
