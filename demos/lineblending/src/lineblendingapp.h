	/**
	 * Demo application that is called from within the main loop
	 *
	 * Shows a line that morphs from target A to target B over time based on a blend speed.
	 * The resulting line is projected onto a canvas that is used to define the laser projection bounds.
	 * If you happen to have an etherdream DAC you can configure it in the json file. 
	 * The blend result is sent to the laser over the network. This application also works without a laser attached to your network. 
	 *
	 * This demo uses of a lot of custom components that are defined in mod_lineblending.
	 * The various components automate the line selection process and modulate the line based on a set of conditions.
	 * Take a look at the various components for a better understanding of what they do.
	 * The app contains 3 important entities: a line, a laser, and a camera. The canvas is a child entity of the laser
	 * The canvas entity uses the information from the laser entity to position itself in space and give itself the right dimensions.
	 * The laser DAC is a resource and is referenced by the LaserOutputComponent that lives under the laser entity.
	 * The laser output component translates the line coordinates to laser coordinates and pushes those to the laser DAC resource.
	 * 
	 * Every line is a resource of type 'PolyLine', which in turn is a generic mesh.
	 * The target (output) line is called 'DisplayLine'. This mesh is continuously updated by the various
	 * components that live under the line entity. The 'source' lines are individual resources that the line blend component
	 * interpolates in between. The result of that operation is stored in the display line.
	 * The display line also has normals which are visualized and used to add a displacement effect.
	 *
	 * All the parameters in the GUI can be saved and read from disk as a preset.
	 * The demo uses multiple parameter groups (nap::ParameterGroup) to group parameters together in logical sections.
	 * Every parameter group contains one or multiple parameters of a specific type. The nap::ParameterGUI
	 * renders the group and all of it's children to screen. * Parameters and parameter groups are declared in JSON and are regular resource. 
	 * You can link to parameters directly from other components and resources. 
	 * Refer to the LineNoiseComponent and LineBlendComponent of this application to see how to access and use them.
	 *
	 * Mouse and key events are forwarded to the input service, the input service collects input events
	 * and processes all of them on update. Because NAP does not have a default space (objects can
	 * be rendered in multiple ways), you need to specify what input actually means to the application. 
	 * The input router does that for you. This demo uses the default one that forwards the events to every input component.
