	 * This demo demonstrates how to use a Curve (resource) to animate a sphere.
	 * Use Napkin (our editor) to update or alter the various points of the curve.
	 * Edits to the curve in Napkin are directly applied to the animation of the sphere in the live running demo!
	 * Curve edits are stored in the curveball.json file and applied immediately when the file is saved.
	 * The component inside mod_curveball actually animates the sphere based on the value read from the curve.
