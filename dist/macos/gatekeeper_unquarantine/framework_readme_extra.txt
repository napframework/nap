macOS GATEKEEPER QUARANTINING
-----------------------------

If you are seeing security issues getting the framework running on macOS visit 
the install section of the documentation (linked above) for assistance removing 
the framework from macOS' Gatekeeper quarantine. In short: the script 
tools/unquarantine_framework.command needs to be run (via ctrl-click from Finder).
