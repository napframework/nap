NAP PACKAGE
===========

INFORMATION
-----------

NAP framework is an open source, real-time control & visualization plaform. 

Use any protocol (OSC, MIDI, Art-Net, Websockets etc) in combination with a 3D 
graphics and sound engine to create real-time content that is transmitted to 
any device you like. NAP is built to scale up to a large number of input and 
outputdevices: many displays, many lights, many speakers, many sensors.
	
NAPs design is intended to be as open as possible: there is little fixed 
functionality, but there are a lot of useful blocks that can be tied together 
by a user to create the experience you desire. As a user, you can build new 
blocks yourself and throw them in the mix to fulfill your creative vision. 
To push creativity, NAP is built to provide extremely fast iteration times.

Central to NAP are a couple of key philosophies:

- NAP is completely data driven
- NAP is heavily influenced by modern game engine design, with one exception:
- NAP does not dictate any sort of pipeline
- NAP applications are lean and mean, only package and ship what you use
- NAP is easy to extend: build your own modules, resources and components
- NAP wants you to be safe and validates data for you
- NAP is responsive: hot-load content changes directly in to the running app
- NAP is completely cross-platform and supports all modern desktop environments
- NAP app content can be edited using an editor
