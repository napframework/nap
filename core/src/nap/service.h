	 * A Service is a process within core that cooperates with certain components in the system, this is the base
	 * class for all services. Often services are used to load a driver, set up a connection or manage global module
	 * specific state. All services are automatically loaded and managed by Core. This ensures the right service order of
	 * initialization, runtime state and closing. When designing a module using a service make sure to export the
	 * service using the 'NAP_SERVICE_MODULE' #define in a source file exactly once, for example:
	 *
	 *~~~~~{.cpp}
	 * NAP_SERVICE_MODULE("mod_naposc", "0.2.0", "nap::OSCService")
	 *~~~~~
	 *
	 * This code snippet ensures that core automatically loads, creates and initializes the service when loading the modules.
