	 * The resource manager is responsible for loading a JSON file that contains all the resources that are necessary for an application to run.
	 * 
	 * When loading a JSON file all the objects declared inside that file are created and initialized by the resource manager. 
	 * These objects are called 'resources'. Every loaded resource is owned by the resource manager. 
	 * This means that the lifetime of a resource is fully managed by the resource manager and not by the client.
	 * The resource manager also updates the content in real-time when a change to the loaded JSON file is detected.
	 * 
	 * Every resource has a unique identifier, as declared by the 'mID' property. The name of the object is required to be unique.
	 * De-serialization will fail when a duplicate object ID is discovered. 
	 *
	 * The most important task of a resource is to tell the resource manager if initialization succeeded. 
	 * If initialization of a resource fails the resource manager will halt execution, return an error message and 
	 * as a result stop further execution of a program.
	 *
	 * loadFile() is automatically called by the nap::AppRunner on startup, using the data file linked to by the nap::ProjectInfo

		* Loads a json file containing objects. When the objects are loaded, a comparison is performed against the objects that are already loaded. Only

		* or changed then receives an init() call in the correct dependency order: if an object has a pointer to another object, the pointee is initted
		* first. In case an already existing object that wasn't in the file points to something that is changed, that object is recreated by 
		* cloning it and then calling init() on it. That also happens in the correct dependency order.
		*
		* Because there may be other objects pointing to objects that were read from json (which is only allowed through the ObjectPtr class), the updating
		* mechanism patches all those pointers before calling init(). 
		*
		* In case one of the init() calls fail, the previous state is completely restored by patching the pointers back and destroying objects that were read.
		* The client does not need to worry about handling such cases.
		* In case all init() calls succeed, any old objects are destructed (the cloned and the previously existing objects).
		*
		* Before objects are destructed, onDestroy is called. onDestroy is called in the reverse initialization order. This way, it is still safe to use any 
		* pointers to perform cleanup of internal data.
