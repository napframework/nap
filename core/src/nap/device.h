	 * Special type of Resource that represents a device. Only 1 instance of a device is allowed to run at the same time.
	 * For example: If you have a device that opens a specific port, that port can't be opened twice. Initialization should fail because of this reason. 
	 * The solution is to start() and stop() the device when 2 (or more) instances of that same device exist during the real-time edit fase. 
	 * In this specific case the port is closed when the device is stopped (first instance) before being opened on start (second instance).
	 *
	 * The Device class deals with this case by providing an explicit start / stop virtual, which are called at appropriate times by the ResourceManager.
	 * It's important that both start & stop can be called multiple times. start is always called before stop. stop is only called when start succeeded.
