	 * After creation, initialize the core engine by invoking initializeEngine(). This will
	 * load all the available modules and their dependencies including services.
	 * When all modules are loaded all available services are initialized.
	 * Initialization occurs based on the Service dependency tree. So when Service B points to A,
	 * Service A is initialized before B. After initialization all module specific resources and their
	 * contexts are available for object creation using the ResourceManager.
	 *
	 * Call update inside your app loop to update all available services. When exiting the application
	 * invoke shutdown. This will close all operating services in the reverse order of their dependency tree
